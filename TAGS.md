Tags
====================

Here's a quick overview on how to use the tagging system in this repo.

As things are moving along, and we're starting to get some docs issue logged in
the repo it's become increasingly apparent that our tagging system in there is
somewhat lacking. So I've decided to take a page out of the mainapp repo, and
reorganize our tags.

Come on this journey with me...

## Doc

**Doc - Update (1)** - any docs that need a facelift because of new features added
to the app, old screenshots. The fix for anything under this tag should be
pretty quick--updating some wording, adding a new section, flipping out some
screenshots.

**Doc - Improve (2)** - any doc that could be expanded upon, or is feeling dusty.
Something in this realm would be shabby integration docs, updates to social
sharing docs. The fix for anything under this tag will take a little more
rewriting--won't be quite as immediate.

**Doc - New (3)** - opportunities for brand new docs. I expect this one won't be
used a lot, but if we need new pages devoted to something, or entire
restructuring, it would go in this tag. These would be pretty labor intensive
tasks. Also under this bucket is docs so old they just need to be rewritten/ditched.

## Videos

**Doc Vid - Update (1)** - any videos you find (within the docs) that need new
screencasts or language updates. Should be a pretty easy fix.

**Doc Vid - Improve (2)** - any videos that need to be partially re-written and/or
expanded. Something in this realm would require us to potentially reshoot the
docs or re-record voice overs.

**Doc Vid - New (3)** - any videos that a) should be made or b) need to be entirely
rewritten. This is a great place to throw brainstorming ideas.

## Pain

How often do these issues come up? Is it frustrating to our customers in the
inbox? Is it just something we should improve?

**Pain - Low**
**Pain - Medium**
**Pain - High**

## Miscellaneous tags

**In-App Static Doc** - anything under this tag is related in our in-app static
docs (test drive help, popover links/video, etc

**Developer** - Will we need to grab a developer in order to get this doc
sparkling?

**Launch Prep** - re: Timeline Events, Pricing Updates, Multilingual captions,
anything engineering pushes through that should be documented

**Search** - anything to do with improving the search functionality/issues with
user experience and/or interacting with our docs

**Typo/Old Screenshot** - pretty self-explanatory. Simple fixes/bugs in our
docs, just a more advanced breakdown of Doc - Update

**Example Needed** - use this tag for developer doc examples, issues that
customers potentially hit, opportunities for use-cases within the docs

**Redirect Needed** - this change will require a wistiacom redirect to account
for new structuring

**Overhaul** - anything related to the slated design overhaul of the docs
(October 2015)

**ReOrg** - anything related to the overall restructuring of the docs
(updating the indexes, orphan pages, etc)
