## style tips ##

use a span class "code" for single line code and for pointing out action items
use a div class "github" around Gist embed codes
follows "prism" rules ( http://prismjs.com/ ) for actual code blocks:
Uses &lt;pre&gt; tags, with &lt;code&gt; inside with class 'language-nameoflanguage'
If you have paragraphs next to floated images that are overlapping, throw in a 'div class clear' above them.
