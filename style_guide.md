### use a div class "github" around Gist embed codes

### follows "prism" rules ( http://prismjs.com/ ) for actual code blocks:
  * Uses &lt;pre&gt; tags, with &lt;code&gt; inside with class 'language-nameoflanguage'
  * languages: ruby, javascript, vim (for terminal actions), markdown (html)
  * for single line of code, use language vim or markdown

### For Links: Use the {{ '/relative_url' | post_url }}

### If you have paragraphs next to floated images that are overlapping, throw in a 'div class clear' above them.
