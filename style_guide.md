## style tips ##

if you embed an image that is too wide, use a 'width' attribute to shrinks it down
use div class 'code' for code blocks, with a &lt;pre&gt; inside to prevent lines from breaking
use a span class "code" for single line code and for pointing out action items
use a div class "github" around Gist embed codes
max image size ~700px (may use javascript to fix this)
