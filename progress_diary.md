**Start Date:** July 2 2012
**Goal:** Create a Jekyll-based static site for the Wistia Doc to live on. For customers, will provide a more seamless experience between multiple Wistia web presence(s). For internal Wistians, will make doc easier to update, both style and content-wise.

## july 2 ##

* Established the Jekyll base for future Jekyll projects.
* Used a Dokuwiki-to-markdown converter to get text ready for the big time
* Started basic styling

## july 3 ##

* Experimented with several Jekyll forks to find good support for HAML.  Still no good ones.
* More styling

## july 5 ##

* Installed Foreman to handle Jekyll server and Compass updates.  Still need to add HAML updates.  Foreman is SICK (adding 'foreman start' to rake task 'jekyll preview').
* (-) TODO: get a permalink icon for the left of the H2 (perhaps using a :before CSS3) emulating Campaign Monitor ( http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/account/ )
* (X) TODO: get Joe to look at it and start thinking about design / platform for this / resource center

## july 7 ##

* got the highlight of current section working with One Page Nav jQuery plug-in ( http://trevordavis.net/blog/jquery-one-page-navigation-plugin/ ). Similar to what I put together in the Data API page but prob better :)
* TODO: add search in the upper right of the page
* inspiration: http://popcornjs.org/popcorn-docs/index.html
* need to figure out YAML -- think it's worked out.
* added the 'footer' section - currently used for 'developers' vs 'non-developers' but could also be for different difficulty ratings.

## july 13 ##

* been working on the design and some javascript to make the layout more consistent and easy to do.  Still needs some work.
* majority of work has been converting the content (moving the images over, updating embeds, etc.)
* big project next is implementation of search - seems like plugin may be the answer
* search resources:

  * http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/

## july 14 ##

* added (back) a glossary, for simplifying the explainers in the doc pages...perhaps to move to 'asides' later?
* wrote the js to handle the title height positioning
* TODO: get the shadow around the video embeds right
* removed media stats page and heatmaps page, merged with analytics
* removed "for marketers" guide
* TODO: re-grab lots of images

## july 16 ##

* TODO: something be wrong with the js related to p tags - see 'private-analytics.html'
* TODO: emulate GitHub help with 'bootcamp', 'breadcrumbs'
* TODO: Github also has sweet 'drawers'

## july 17 ##

* drawer ideas: 'don't have a video?', 'what is embedding?', 'what are heatmaps?'
* holy crap, finally finished first pass of the content
* TODO: run through images and start pulling new ones
* TODO: get on the main page
