**Start Date:** July 2 2012
**Goal:** Create a Jekyll-based static site for the Wistia Doc to live on. For customers, will provide a more seamless experience between multiple Wistia web presence(s). For internal Wistians, will make doc easier to update, both style and content-wise.

## july 2 ##

* Established the Jekyll base for future Jekyll projects.
* Used a Dokuwiki-to-markdown converter to get text ready for the big time
* Started basic styling

## july 3 ##

* Experimented with several Jekyll forks to find good support for HAML.  Still no good ones.
* More styling

## july 5 ##

* Installed Foreman to handle Jekyll server and Compass updates.  Still need to add HAML updates.  Foreman is SICK (adding 'foreman start' to rake task 'jekyll preview').
* TODO: get a permalink icon for the left of the H2 (perhaps using a :before CSS3) emulating Campaign Monitor ( http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/account/ )
* TODO: get Joe to look at it and start thinking about design / platform for this / resource center

## july 7 ##

* got the highlight of current section working with One Page Nav jQuery plug-in ( http://trevordavis.net/blog/jquery-one-page-navigation-plugin/ ). Similar to what I put together in the Data API page but prob better :)
* TODO: add search in the upper left of the page
* inspiration: http://popcornjs.org/popcorn-docs/index.html
* need to figure out YAML
