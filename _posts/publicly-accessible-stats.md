If you want to share stats for one of your videos by link, we can provide you with a publicly accessible page with anonymized statistics (i.e. the emails are removed!).

However, this functionality is not enabled by default, so before continuing, please [ contact us ]( mailto:support@wistia.com ) to request it to be enabled for your account.

The next step is to craft a link which your site's visitors can use to access your video's statistics.

The URL for the link should be in the form of...
	
<span class="code">http://app.wistia.com/stats/&lt;media-id&gt;</span>

...where <span class="code">&lt;media-id&gt;</span> is the unique id representing your video.  You can find the id for a video in the address bar at the top of your browser while you are on the video's page in Wistia.

{% post_image hashed_id: '8b6f4b90426a391f8cd5c039837cea16403ab00d', class: 'center' %}

The characters at the end of the URL are a unique id just for your video.  The id to use from the screenshot below would be **p9wrk3464f**.  So the URL for the stats for that video would be <span class="code">http://app.wistia.com/stats/p9wrk3464f</span>.

The publicly accessible stats page looks similar to the main stats pages, except with identifiable information removed!
