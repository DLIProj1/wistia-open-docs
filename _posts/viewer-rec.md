## Operating Systems Supported

No worries on which operating system your viewers are using - Wistia is
friendly with almost every OS on every planet we are aware of, including
Mac OS, Windows, and Linux.

## Browsers Supported

Wistia will work on any browser that supports Adobe Flash and/or HTML5.
The only requirement for viewing Flash content is Flash Player 9 or greater.
To check which version of Flash you are running, head to their
[download page](http://www.adobe.com/support/flash/downloads.html).
To ensure the best play-back, we typically recommend remaining up to date with
your Flash version whenever possible.

For media other than video, No PDF reader is required, as we convert documents
to a Flash format as well.

We also work with all of the major browsers and versions Internet Explorer
(7,8, and 9), Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, etc.

## Mobile OS Support

At this point, there are basically two main methods to view video on the mobile 
web: `Flash` and `HTML5`. Newer Android phones (4.1 and up) and iOS devices,
such as iPhones and iPads, support HTML5.

Older Android devices have a *native playback* mode and support for flash.
Our embed codes are designed to seamlessly flip between HTML5 and Flash,
based on the type of device and OS detected.

We have found the most consistent support on all iOS devices, and Android
devices running version 2.2 or later.

Blackberry at this point supports neither HTML5 or Flash. As a result, there
is not a consistently available way to deliver video via the web to Blackberry
devices.

Basically, if you can view videos on YouTube or any other major video site,
you (and your viewers) should be all set to use Wistia.
