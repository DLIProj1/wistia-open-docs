  We're using WordPress here, but you can use all sorts of website setups / CMS environments with Wistia.  Check out our [list of tested sites]({{ '/integration' | post_url }}).
* <a href="#" class="chapter_link" onclick="wistiaEmbed.time(35).play(); return false;"><i class="icon-play"></i>(0:35)</a> 
  Normally Alyce sets up the WordPress blog post, and then tells me what size the video needs to be to fit within the post. We've also chosen a color we use for all our blog embeds.
* <a href="#" class="chapter_link" onclick="wistiaEmbed.time(60).play(); return false;"><i class="icon-play"></i>(1:00)</a> 
  All settings within the SuperEmbed builder apply to **embedded** video only, not video that plays from within your account.  It also doesn't update videos that are already embedded - if you have already embedded the video on your site, and want to change settings in the SuperEmbed builder, you'll need to re-embed the video.
* <a href="#" class="chapter_link" onclick="wistiaEmbed.time(71).play(); return false;"><i class="icon-play"></i>(1:11)</a> 
  When in doubt, use iframe.  API embed codes are useful for interacting with the video using our [Player API]({{ '/player-api' | post_url }}), and SEO embeds (which appear once you have a validated sitemap) are useful for SEO benefits.
* <a href="#" class="chapter_link" onclick="wistiaEmbed.time(160).play(); return false;"><i class="icon-play"></i>(2:40)</a> 
  In the post-roll menu, you can chose to use a text, image, or custom HTML post-roll.  You can also customize the overlay color to match your video!
* <a href="#" class="chapter_link" onclick="wistiaEmbed.time(180).play(); return false;"><i class="icon-play"></i>(3:00)</a> 
  Pre-roll email capture, or Turnstile, is easy-to-use and super powerful for gathering emails. To read more click [here](http://wistia.com/product/turnstile).

  One feature we didn't cover in the SuperEmbed builder is [Transcripts]({{ '/transcripts' | post_url }}).
* <a href="#" class="chapter_link" onclick="wistiaEmbed.time(260).play(); return false;"><i class="icon-play"></i>(4:20)</a> 
  We had a bit too much espresso in the filming of this episode.
