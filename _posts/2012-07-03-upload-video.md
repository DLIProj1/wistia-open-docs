## Uploading a Video

All content in Wistia must be uploaded inside a Project.  Projects work just like folders on your computer - great for organizing and managing your stuff.

To create a new Project, select "New Project" under the Actions menu on the Projects list page of your account (where all your other Projects are listed).

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="/images/upload-select3.png" alt="upload-select3" width="161px" /></div>

Once you are in your new Project, you can give it a title by clicking the "edit" tag next to the title bar (where it currently says "Untitled Project").  Now we're ready to upload a video.

Next, select "Upload Media" under the Project Actions menu..

From the upload dialogue box, choose the file to upload from your local computer.  To upload multiple media at once, hold down the shift or control buttons while browsing.

Once a file has been chosen, you will see the progress of the file uploading as in the image below.

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/uploading1.png" alt="uploading1" width="450px" /></div>

If you are having trouble with uploads completing, please try our [simple uploader without the progress bar](/simple-uploader.html).

For instructions on the best way to encode your video prior to uploading it, check our [video exporting page](/exporting.html).

## Can I queue multiple files to upload?

Yes. When the "choose a file" dialog appears after selecting the "Upload media" item, hold down the shift or ctrl buttons while browsing to select multiple files.
