## Enabling the Wistia Data API

Before you can start developing applications that use the API, you need to enable your account for API access.  If your account is on a plan that has Data API support included, you will be able to access your API settings from the Account Settings page:
{{ :api-enable-1.png?600 |Find the API settings on the Account Settings page}}

This will bring up a dialog box that allows you to enable API access.  Click the button labeled "Enable API Access" to generate an API password for your account.
{{ :api-enable-2.png?600 |Click 'Enable API Access' to enable API access}}

Once you have clicked on the "Enable API Access" button, the dialog will refresh and you'll be able to get your API password.  The user name for API access is always "api".

**Note:** If you disable API access to your account and then choose to re-enable it later, your API password will change!
