## Invite Viewers

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/42611fc9a1641be9e8374afd496a20e01abffcc6.png" alt="share_proj" /></div>



Managers in your Wistia account can invite new viewers to view private content using the "Share by Email" feature.  From the Project screen, select "Share Project" from under the green "Project Actions" drop-down menu.

Enter the email addresses of contacts you would like to share this project privately with.  You can then set whether they need to create a password.  At the bottom, you can customize the text from the message they will receive to first access the content you've allowed them to view.


<div class="post_image center"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/fd253ac4993cee49f0a3b6dfbfb5fc5df2adab6d.png" alt="share_box" /></div>



**FAQ:** *Why don't I set a password for my viewers?*

The best way for unwanted viewers to view secure content is through the original email.  Sending a group email that contains the login and password needed to access secure content can be grabbed easily: from a stolen laptop, from a hacked email account, even read right off the screen at a coffee shop.  With Wistia, your invited viewers receive an email with a one-time use activation code, and then create their own password.

## Privately share video by link

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/271cc76d4c475b6997d5b9c49f6ee087c9badd50.png" alt="share-project" /></div>

This is the best sharing method to use if you want to:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;"><li>Send out a single link from your own email account to a group people to allow them to view your video</li>
<li>Track how people watch your video, but are less concerned about associating viewing with a viewer's email address</li></ul>
 
Once you have uploaded your videos to your project, from within the project hover over the "Project Actions" menu and choose the "Share Project" option.

<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/7fe31ba39993a9f10f9416325c68a3f710d1d4f4.png" alt="share_by_link" /></div>

When the dialog appears choose the tab which says "Share by Link".  The screen to the left will be seen.  To create a link which can be pasted into an email, click the "Enable sharing by link for this project" button.

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/0157656ae67a9ee92aa77f99f8235b8db2b8b1df.png" alt="share-by-link-2" /></div>

Once the button has been clicked, the link will appear.  You can simply copy this link and paste it into an email or put it on a webpage.  When users click on this link, they will automatically be taken into this Wistia project.

If the "Disable sharing by link for this project" is clicked the previous project link will no longer be active.  Users that click on a disabled link will be denied access to your content.

## Managing Permissions

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/79c437faf6d7df72b320256c45e1a5e8082eed16.png" alt="manage_link" /></div>


Wistia accounts include permissions and access controls for managers, to set who can view media and what they can view.  To manage permissions for contacts on a Project, click the "Manage" link under the 'Sharing' Sidebar Element.



<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/777cd4548ed48ebee4e7bec3327a61c74559f34e.png" alt="share_screen" /></div>
The share screen shows which users currently have access to the Project, and what permissions they have.  From here, managers can add permissions like:

*  Upload, which allows the viewer to upload new content
*  Download, which allows the viewer to download content from the Project
*  Share, which means the viewer can share the Project with new viewers

Removing viewer access can also be done by clicking the small trash can icon at the end of each viewer row.

## Review Your Viewers Activity

Now that you have invited some viewers in to view your private content, it's time to see if they actually watched!  This is especially helpful for reviews and approvals and training or educational content.

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/66053f64b40ce2f176637e495273eb93d4f49dd2.png" alt="private_user_sessions_dropdown" /></div>

To view the individual user statistics for people you invited into Wistia, select the "User sessions" option under the "Stats" tab at the top of any page in your Wistia account.

You will see a list of all user sessions for the users that have logged into your Wistia account.  To see exactly what each user did in each session, click on the "Stats" magnifying glass next to the session.

A complete audit trail will be shown with all of the actions the user took while they were logged in to your Wistia account.  This includes amount of time spent on various pages as well as video heatmaps for the videos that they viewed.

## How Wistia Appears For Your Viewers

When you invite new viewers into your account to privately view video, they will only have access to parts of the account that have been shared with them or they have been giving access to.  Let's walk through an example of how this will look from your viewer's perspective.



### The Share Dialog Box

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/fd253ac4993cee49f0a3b6dfbfb5fc5df2adab6d.png" alt="ben-share2" /></div>

We'll start with a quick review of the Share dialog box.

Enter the emails of the people you'd like to invite in the “Share with” box. Assign the permissions you'd like them to have for this project. You can allow them to upload, download original files, or share with others.

You can also choose whether the user needs a password to access the content. If you choose to require a password (more secure), the user will be prompted to create a password when they click on the link in the email. In the future, the user will be required to enter their email and password in order to gain access to the content that has been shared with them. If no password is required, the user will be taken directly to the project upon clicking the link.

You can also customize the wording of the email message that will be sent to the people you are inviting. 

### The Invitation Email

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/ef169c85d0894e2cb800fe376e21b4fea0aee88e.png" alt="shared-email1" /></div>

After clicking the "Share" button, your viewer will receive an email at the address you have designated.  This email will include an invitation to view the project you are sharing, along with a link for their access.  This activation link is specifically designed for their email, and is only good for one use (the email cannot be forwarded).


### The Credential Creation Screen

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/6dc3b3ce1c35d22643f5105de3e1ae1140aa3355.png" alt="credentials2" /></div>

After clicking the activation link, viewers who have never interacted with the Wistia system will land on a page where they can create Wistia credentials.  If you have required them to use a password to access the content, they will need to create a password for their access as well.

### The Viewer's Perspective

When your viewer logs in, they will enter the Project you have shared with them, but they will see it in a functionally stripped down way.  The tabs will not contain any information specific to the account, nor will it allow the viewer access to the other Projects in the account, etc.


Use the slider to test out the difference between views!

To hide the sharing list from viewers, simply hover over the "Sharing" sidebar element on the right-hand side of the Project, and click the trash can icon that appears next to the word 'Sharing'.  To bring the sidebar element back at any time, choose "Add Sidebar Element" under the"Project Actions" drop-down and then add a "Sharing List" sidebar element.
