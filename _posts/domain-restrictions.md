Domain restrictions apply to all videos in your account. To get started with
video embed domain restrictions:

1. Head to to your Wistia Account Dashboard and click on the new button titled "Embed Settings".
2. A dialog box will open where you can configure your domain restrictions (see image below).  Click the "Enabled" radio button and type the domains that you wish to use for your embeds into the box (comma separated).  Press the "Save Embed Settings" button when finished.
3. Put your embed on a webpage hosted on a domain you entered in Step #2 and you are good to go!
