With the Wistia-Pardot integration you can:

- Generate leads from your videos
- See how prospects are watching them
- Drive automated workflows based on video activity data
- Use video and email together in marketing harmony ðŸ’•

Sound fun? That's because it _is_ fun. And it's easy! This page will give you everything you need to get started and be successful.

## Get Set Up

First things first, let's connect the puzzle pieces.

What you'll need:

- A [Pardot](http://pardot.com) account
- A Wistia account on the [Enterprise](http://wistia.com/pricing) plan ('cause you're a rather enterprising individual)

**1. Add your Pardot account in Wistia**

In Wistia, go to the Integrations section of your account settings. Enter the credentials you use to login to Pardot, along with your Pardot API User Key (which you can find in [your Pardot settings](https://pi.pardot.com/account)).

Click that blue "Connect Pardot" button, and you're halfway set up! Proceed to step 2 ðŸ‘‡

**2. Add your _Wistia_ account in _Pardot_**

In your Pardot account, click the Admin menu at the top of the page, and choose the Connector section. From there, click Add Connector, and choose Wistia under Video Connectors. That'll bring you to a form quite like this:

{% post_image hashed_id: 'ebbf9841c910fea77bb16b74ea03430d95213ef1', class: 'center' %}

Check the "Show Video Play Heatmaps" box, and then fill in your API Password and Public Token from Wistia. [Here's a guide on how to find those]({{ '/account-setup#api_access' | post_url }}). Then click *Create Connector*, and do <a href="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/0ojtk98of1?popover=true" class="wistia-popover[height=480,playerColor=78a8eb,width=640]">the "My Wistia and Pardot accounts are connected at last!" dance</a>. Read on for details about what you can do with your newfound powers.

## Collect contact information with Turnstile

With [Turnstile]({{ '/turnstile' | post_url }}), you can ask people to enter their names and email addresses at the beginning, middle, or end of your videos. And now that you have Wistia connected to Pardot, that information will automatically create a new Prospect record in your Pardot Account. Woo!

"Hold on, Wistia. What if the person is already an existing Prospect in Pardot" you ask? In that case, [WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT CASE?].

Here's an example Turnstile on one of our videos:

{% wistia_embed hashed_id: 5jbejtwgwi %}

If that was _your_ video, you'd be generating new leads right this very moment. So, go ahead and [embed your own video]({{ '/embedding' | post_url }}) to get started! You can find Turnstile in the [Timeline Actions]({{ '/customizing-your-video#timeline_actions' | post_url }}) section of the Customize panel.

## Track video-related events from your website in Pardot

If you have a video embedded in your website, you can see in Pardot...

Just be sure that you have Pardot's tracking code on the page, and that your Wistia embed code has the `wistia_embed` class (as it should by default).
