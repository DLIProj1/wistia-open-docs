## You’re an agency if

* You use words like “leveraging brand equity across the digital landscape.”
* You actually know what a codec is.
* You know that audience engagement isn’t about saying yes to the dress.

## Current Agency Customer blurbs

* Aaron Booker / Varvid
* Wayne Ferris / IllustrateIt
* Josh Backer / Animal

## What is the Agency plan?

It is a version of Wistia that combines all the great stuff of Wistia in general with specific features that agencies want.

What are the specific Agency features?

* Multi-account usage roll-up - Agency “dashboard” - 
* Create client accounts yourself
* Main account for Agency marketing use
* Main account for Agency - Client private collaboration - review & approvals workflow
* Media copy across accounts
* White-label


## Why would I want an Agency Plan?

*You are a professional. Wistia is for professionals. Period. End of discussion.*

You have clients that could benefit from a more cohesive video marketing strategy - and would love to pay you to manage it :)
