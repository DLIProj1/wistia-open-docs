description: Wistia plays well with lots of 3rd party services. See some of the best, and how to use them, in this article.
post_intro: <p>As we update our embedding processes and APIs, Wistia will get better and better at integrating with other top-notch services. On this doc page, we'll do our best to keep track of places where Wistia works out-of-the-box for embedding, and also where deeper integrations have been built out by our awesome friends.</p><p>If you currently use a service that you think rocks, and would work well with Wistia, submit your request in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/wistia.com/forms/d/1x2Z2KUdxXKhPYpfzfQJLVq7upAnhryBWZt2Y4IUPiTs/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a>.</p>

Read up on the [Pardot integration page]({{ '/pardot' | post_url }}).

## HubSpot

{% post_image hashed_id: '1b11fe5536f67f70699d752ca1e7f11775dd5f32', class: 'integration_logo' %}

Using the [HubSpot integration](http://knowledge.hubspot.com/how-to-integrate-hubspot-and-wistia) with Wistia, you can get all your HubSpot customer data in the same spot for prime data organization.

You can learn how to set this up over on [HubSpot's site](http://knowledge.hubspot.com/how-to-integrate-hubspot-and-wistia) or [in our docs]({{ '/hubspot' | post_url }})

## WordPress

{% post_image hashed_id: 'bdad3d0b4f6e6581194fbcbd25dd9626501c7c80', width: 200, class: 'integration_logo' %}

Using the [Wistia WordPress Plug-in](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wistia-wordpress-oembed-plugin), you can add your embed codes and they will be protected. It won't take up any space in your WordPress admin dashboard, but instead works quietly in the background (as it should).

We have some other information on using Wistia and WordPress, including styling tips (we so stylish!) on the [WordPress integration page]({{ "/wordpress" | post_url }}).

{{ "Wistia embed codes can only be used with WordPress.org installs. <a href='http://en.support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org'>Read up on the difference between WordPress.com hosted blogs and WordPress installs</a>." | note }}

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/how-it-works/) is a system that allows users to connect all sorts of web apps to each other, creating "zaps" to automate repetitive tasks with little to no trouble at all. Wistia is now featured among the list of web apps they integrate with, giving you even more power for connecting Wistia with all your other favorite web services.

On the Zapbook page for Wistia, Zapier has handily included a bunch of sample zaps to help you get the ball rolling--just [head over to that zapbook](https://zapier.com/zapbook/wistia/) to get started!

With Wistia and Squarespace, embedding a video is as easy as pasting in your URL.

## Drupal

Right now Wistia embed codes have only been tested and verified through Drupal v6.

Compatibility beyond v6 is not yet guaranteed.

[Give us a shout](http://wistia.com/support/contact) if you'd like help setting
that up.

## Wix

{% post_image hashed_id: 'eaa07cfdb573a9e1c555947d25bf10933de060e3', width: 200, class: 'integration_logo' %}

To embed a Wistia video in your Wix website, go to *Add --> Widgets --> HTML*. Click on the '*Settings*' for the HTML widget and you can paste your Wistia embed code where it reads '*Insert HTML Code*'. Once you save it, you should be all set.

{{ "Some Wix layouts do not reload the window to change pages, essentially creating HTML overlays that leave your video playing in the background." | note }}
