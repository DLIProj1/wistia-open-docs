description: Wistia plays well with lots of 3rd party services. See some of the best, and how to use them, in this article.
post_intro: <p>As we update our embedding processes and APIs, Wistia will get better and better at integrating with other top-notch services. On this doc page, we'll do our best to keep track of places where Wistia works out-of-the-box for embedding, and also where deeper integrations have been built out by our awesome friends.</p><p>If you currently use a service that you think rocks, and would work well with Wistia, submit your request in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/wistia.com/forms/d/1x2Z2KUdxXKhPYpfzfQJLVq7upAnhryBWZt2Y4IUPiTs/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a>.</p>
