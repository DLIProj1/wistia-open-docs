# Video SEO with Wistia

Video SEO is the act of proactively submitting your content, through what’s called a “Video Sitemap", so that it’s easier for Google and other search engines to find it.

Once your video sitemap is submitted your videos can:


*  Appear inline in universal search results

*  Send people directly to your website when clicked on in search results

*  Boost overall placement for your page

*  Appear in video specific search results, like http://video.google.com

Wistia helps you create, host, and submit your video sitemap.

## Setup

Video SEO with Wistia requires a little setup. The first thing you need to do is authorize Wistia to host your video sitemap and reference pages on your site. This is done through the robots.txt file on your web server.  The robots.txt is a file (almost) every website has that helps search engines know what content they can and can’t index. The robots.txt also has the ability to inform and authorize sitemaps for your website.

To get started, choose "Video SEO" under the Account tab from any page in your Wistia account.  \\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
`<style float-left>`{{:video-seo-setup.png?400|}}`</style>`\\
You will see the following instructions.  Once you have added the line to your robots.txt and typed the URL, click the "Verify your robots.txt" button.  This will retrieve your specified robots.txt and verify that the information is viewable by Google.

Once you have completed the above steps, you are all set up and now have the ability to add entries to your video sitemap from Wistia.




## Making a video sitemap entry

Once you have made and verified the entry in your robots.txt file, you will be able to add entries to your video sitemap.  Once a video sitemap entry is made, it will be automatically picked up by Google and your content will be indexed according to Google's indexing queue.

The process to make a new video sitemap entry is extremely easy.  After you have embedded a video on your website, go to the page in Wistia where you can view the video (e.g. `<youraccount>`.wistia.com/medias/12345 ).  Hover over the Media Actions menu and select "Add to SEO sitemap".   
\\
\\
This will then bring up a dialog box where you can enter the relevant information about your video.  Simply enter the required information and click "Add to video sitemap".  Your sitemap will then be automatically updated and we will inform Google that there are new changes that should be indexed.

Once you have made one or more video sitemap entries, you can easily manage the videos from your video SEO dashboard within Wistia.  Simply hover over the Account tab on any Wistia page and choose the "Video SEO" option. 

This will take you to the video SEO dashboard where you can:

*  See all videos currently in your sitemap

*  Edit the sitemap entries by clicking the "Edit" button on any entry

*  Remove any entries that may no longer be valid using the "Remove" button
