## Setup Your Email Provider Integration

Once enabled, a video using Turnstile will automatically track the emails entered 
by your viewers in [Wistia analytics]({{ '/embedded-video-analytics' | post_url}}),
but it is most powerful when connected to your favorite email provider.

To set up the connection, first open your [Account Dashboard]({{ '/account-setup#open_your_account_dashboard' | post_url }}).

Find the *Setup an Email Provider* option.

Select your provider from the list, and select <span

Each provider needs a different set of information - you can see what info is
required on the configuration page. Emma, for example, requires the following
information from your Emma account: your Public API, Private Key, and Account
ID. We also try to include some pointers on where to find this info.

## Use Your Email Provider With Turnstile

Once your account is set up to use an email provider with Turnstile, you can set 
up a Turnstile-enabled embed to collect email addresses, and pass them directly
into a specific group in your connected email provider.

Inside the [Customize screen]({{ '/embed-screen' | post_url }}), find the 
*Turnstile Email Capture* options area. Select *Enable*, and then select the 
email list (group) you want the email to be added to when viewers submit their 
email.

Watch your lists grow! It's a thing of beauty :) 

## How To Use Turnstile Without an Integrated Email Provider

Unfortunately, we aren't able to integrate with all of the awesome email providers in the world. If that is the case for you, you can follow these simple steps to get the emails returned from Turnstile right into the lists of any provider you'd like. If you navigate to the Media that you want to gather emails from and select *Stats* from the *Video Actions* drop down, you will be brought to the Stats page for that project.

Then, scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and select *Export Stats to CSV*â€”it'll be on the right side. That will send a sweet spreadsheet of all that information right to the email associated with your account, where you can copy and paste them into the email provider of your choice! How awesome is that?!
