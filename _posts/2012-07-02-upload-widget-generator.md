## Upload Widget Generator

The Upload Widget Generator helps you get an embed code to place an [upload widget]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/upload-widget.html) on your page.  You must have admin permissions to the project in order for this to work.

To generate an upload widget embed code for a project, follow these steps:

 1.  Login to Wistia and navigate to the project for which you would like to create an upload widget
 2.  From the "Project Actions" menu, select "Get Upload Widget"\\ {{ :get-upload-widget.png?600 |Get Upload Widget}}
 3.  If anonymous uploads are not already enabled for the project, you will be presented with a message explaining the situation and a button to enable anonymous uploads.\\ {{ :upload-widget-enable-anonymous-uploads.png?600 |Enable Anonymous Uploads}}
 4.  You will be presented with a form where you can copy the embed code for your upload widget after customizing the dimensions and/or button text.  You may need to press the **tab** key on your keyboard to navigate to the next field to see the updates from your changes.\\ {{ :embed-upload-widget.png?600 |Embed Upload Widget}}
 5.  When you are finished, copy the HTML/JS code into your own page and try it out.
