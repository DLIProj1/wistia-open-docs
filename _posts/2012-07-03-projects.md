## Create a new Project

{% post_image hashed_id: '46e709a64e16ee0b7f9f780908480281f3db35a2', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

To create a new project, select *New Project* from under the <span class="action_menu">Actions</span> menu.  A new Project will be created, and you will immediately be taken into the new project where you can upload content, invite contacts, and edit the project name.

## Copy an existing Project

{% post_image hashed_id: 'f3c9f1c7deb0e032a0ef0e97665ebbedec99e9dc', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

To copy a Project, select *Copy Project* from under the <span class="action_menu">Actions</span> menu.

This will launch a dialogue box with a drop-down menu that contains all your Projects.  Choosing one from the drop-down will create a duplicate of the Project.

## The Project Title

{% post_image hashed_id: 'c6788df911c325b923258fb21b9984b3c23e538b', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

The title of the Project is how you will find it in your Account.  By default, the title is *Untitled Project*, but that isn't very helpful for organizational purposes! Changing the title of the Project won't affect embed codes or links, either.

<div class='clear'></div>

To edit the title, hover over it with your mouse, and click the <span class="edit_tag">&nbsp;</span> tag. Edit the title text, and press the <span class="code">return</span> key to finish editing.

## Share a Project Privately

Sharing a Project by Email and Link with other viewers is covered in-depth on the [private sharing documentation page]({{ '/private-sharing' | post_url }}).

## Playlists

**Playlists** are a multiple video player that reflects the contents of a Project! You can select <span class='code'>&lt;/&gt; Embed Playlist</span> to get started, or head over to the [playlists doc page]({{ '/playlists' | post_url }}) for more information.

## Project Settings

{% post_image hashed_id: '5525c4a91d2a3b842c51479907d9e7d56cd3bc3a', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

Project Settings are useful for **turning off comments** for a Project and videos therein, and **setting allowable file types for download**.

To get started, select *Project Settings* from under the <span class='action_menu'>Project Actions</span> menu.

### Disable comments for a project

To turn off comments (preventing **ALL** users from seeing or making comments), open the "Project Settings" dialogue from the <span class='action_menu'>Project Actions</span> menu.

Select the *off* option for the Comments setting and click <span class="faux_button">SAVE SETTINGS</span>

### Setting Download Permissions

The other section in the Project Settings dialogue is for setting download permissions to specific file types. If you want all viewers on the Project to be able to download the videos in the Project, but not images, you can control that in the Download Settings Panel. Don't forget to hit <span class="faux_button">SAVE SETTINGS</span> when you are done!

## Project Sections

Project sections allow you to organize media within a project.  Media can be put into project sections and the sections can then expanded or collapsed to provide a cleaner experience for projects with many media. 

{% post_image hashed_id: '55bd7a8a938e7d5ae33df5d91d2c84f1bfe71a6c', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

To create a section, select <span class="code">+ New section</span> from the top of the Project page. A new section will be created, which you can name and drag-and-drop media into. To give the Section a title, hover over the title text, select the <span class="edit_tag"></span>, update the text, and then press <span class='code'>Enter</span>.

### Target sections for upload

When uploading new media into a project with many sections and other media items, it can be very useful to upload directly to one of your sections.

Click the target icon on the right-hand side of the section header and it will turn from gray to red.  While this target icon is red, all media uploaded or copied into the project will automatically be placed in this section.
