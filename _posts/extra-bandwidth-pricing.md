layout: post
plans_comparison: true
post_intro: |
  <p>The updated pricing plans launched in July 2014 include a 
  <strong>$0.33 per GB</strong> flat rate for any extra bandwidth of your
  account might use in a given month.</p>
  <p>We've also updated the extra bandwidth costs for our legacy (previous to
  July 2014) plans, to make sure everyone gets in on the fun.</p>
  <p>See the <a href='http://wistia.com/doc/plans-comparison'>plans comparison</a>
  for in-depth feature breakdowns on each of the new plans.</p>
