layout: post

post_intro: |
  <p>The updated pricing plans launched in July 2014 include a 
  <strong>$0.33 per GB</strong> flat rate for any extra bandwidth up to 1TB your
  account might use in a given month.</p>
  <p>We've also updated the extra bandwidth costs for our legacy (previous to
  July 2014) plans, to make sure everyone gets in on the fun! See the table
  below for those updates.</p>
  <p>See the <a href='http://wistia.com/doc/plans-comparison'>plans comparison</a>
  for in-depth feature breakdowns on each of the new plans.</p>

## How overages work

In the change to feature-based plans, we've changed the way that additional bandwidth works. Formerly, it was a flexible schedule that changed based on usage (which was very complex). The new additional bandwidth pricing is a flat-pricing model that provides advantages for plans in the form of more concrete and easily predictable pricing.

## Legacy Plans (video limited plans)

Bandwidth Usage (per month)   | Price per GB
------------------------------|-----------
All usage up to 1 TB          | $0.25
Next 4 TB of usage                    | $0.18
Next 10 TB  of usage                  | $0.12
Next 35 TB  of usage                  | $0.08
Beyond 50 TB of usage (whoa!)          | $0.06

## Super Pricing Plans (feature limited plans)

Bandwidth Usage (per month)   | Price per GB
------------------------------|-------------
Sub-1 TB plans         | $0.33
1 TB Plan                   | $0.18
5 TB Plan                   | $0.15
15 TB                    | $0.10
