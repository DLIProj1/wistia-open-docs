## Embed Type

{% post_image hashed_id: 'bfdd91709e80b4b863edd798c1a68fa7f9c98183', width: 238, class: 'float_right' %}

There are two main Wistia player embeds types - "inline" and "popovers".
Popovers create a lightbox experience for your viewers.

The advanced embed types area allows you to customize the dimensions on your 
player, and gives you access to advanced embed code types. If you have Video SEO 
sitemaps created, or require access to the player API, these options will appear 
here as well.

## Player Customization

{% post_image hashed_id: '08261a12f14f8e86a0374b8382c627ce7724116e', width: 238, class: 'float_right' %}

Wistia player customization makes it easy to style your video embeds - 
without it getting in the way of what's most important (it's the content!). 
Change the color, pick the controls you want your viewers to see, and set the 
start and end behavior of your video.

**No HD button?**

You got it, no HD button. We approach the HD streaming aspect of video a bit 
differently than most. We use a system we call "Auto HD" that reads what your 
streaming capabilities are when you load the player, then we'll serve you a 
version that streams best for you in terms of quality and playback smoothness. 
HD buttons are a thing of the past!

## Social Sharing

{% post_image hashed_id: '8aef6175577d64c6794497ab41786d438fad57dd', width: 238, class: 'float_right' %}

The social sharing section allows you to add sharing buttons for your favorite 
social services. Let your viewers share links to your content on Facebook and 
Twitter (and many more), and add a badge (like your logo!) in the lower-right-
hand corner. It's easy, clean, and stays out of the way of your video.

If you allow your viewers to copy the embed code of the video, the badge and 
URL will travel with the video, making it a great option for track-back links.

## Call To Action

{% post_image hashed_id: '6e40eba9fdac646820b72e81ab0ceb759b7220ec', width: 238, class: 'float_right' %}

After your video is finished playing, give your viewers an action to take. 
It's a great way to boost engagement and guide your viewers' next steps. 
You can use an image or text URL as a call-to-action link, or enter your own 
HTML (for creating a form, etc.).

## Captions

{% post_image hashed_id: '83b947825a38616ff102fc1bbcd39d1ffecbdfad', width: 238, class: 'float_right' %}

Wistia Interactive Transcripts are excellent for longer-form content and 
SEO purposes.  Control the layout of your transcript when you embed it with 
SuperEmbeds ([more on generating transcripts]({{ '/transcripts' | post_url }})).

Wistia Captions are similar, but are overlayed onto the video, and can be in 
just about any language you can imagine, and work by uploading a custom .srt 
file to your video (we make these for you if you've ordered a transcript).

## Turnstile

If you'd like to capture e-mails in your player, you can set that up in this 
section. We offer a standard version which will attach the e-mails to viewers 
in your account for you to access, as well as an option to connect it with 
lists in your favorite e-mail marketing platform (like MailChimp, Pardot, 
Emma and more).

For those folks who would like some more info on setting up these Turnstile 
integrations, head over to the [Turnstile doc page]({{ '/turnstile' | post_url }}) 
to get all the details on that.

## Grabbing Your Embed Code

{% post_image hashed_id: '00d4331b498946afdd69d5ca8d9909a46398346f', width: 644, class: 'center' %}

Once you've made a really awesome embed for your video, just grab this newly
 customized code and embed away! Careful, you won't be able to make any extra 
 edits to the code in there--all your changes will change back to match the 
 configurations for that page. No funny business! (Not right there, anyway.)
