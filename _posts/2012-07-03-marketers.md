### Step 3. Start Sharing!

Now that you have video uploaded and encoded with Wistia, there are lots of ways you can use that video to start marketing your brand message.  We'll give you a few ideas below, but we're always open to hearing new ones! Shoot us an email at `<support@wistia.com>` if you want to talk through a new idea.

#### Embedding on Your Website

`<style float-right>`{{:embed_video_stroke.png?400}}`</style>`
\\
\\
Embed codes are pieces of code that live inside your web page and are useful for serving up video.  To grab the embed code of a video you have added to your Wistia account, first navigate to the page where you can play the video itself (also known as the "viewing page").  Select the "`</>` Embed" option under the green "Media Actions" drop-down menu.\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
`<style float-right>`{{:superEmbed_dialogue.png?350}}`</style>`
Clicking this "`</>` Embed" option will take you to the Wistia Embed Screen.  This is where you can make some basic changes to the look and feel of your video presentation easily.  Click [here]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/embed_screen.html) for a complete guide to interacting with the Embed Screen.  Once you have all the settings set the way you would like them, copy the embed code from the top box.
\\
\\
Once you have the Embed code, you can place it in an HTML file of your web page editor, or into the edit page of a CMS.  To see a breakdown of the Content Management Services Wistia works well with, and basic description of using Wistia with the CMS, check out our [integration page]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/integration.html).

#### Sharing by Link

To share a video easily by URL, navigate to the media viewer page (where you can view the video you'd like to share). Select the "Share by Link" option under the green "Media Actions" drop-down menu.  Copy that link to send out to your viewers.
\\
\\
*Note:* Stats for these videos will accumulate in the "Public & Embed Stats"

#### Embedding into an Email Marketing Campaign using MailChimp

Connecting with your prospects by email is a great way to make sure your message gets read.  When prospects receive a well-written and concise message to their inbox, it can be a great way to get through the clutter.
\\
\\
This guide is written for use with [MailChimp]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/http://mailchimp.com.html), our favorite email marketing service.  If you use a different email tool, don't despair! Email us at `<support@wistia.com>`, and we'll do our best to get you the best directions.
\\
\\

**Step 1: Set up the video**\\
`<style float-right>`{{:mc_2a.png|}}`</style>`Once you've chosen the video, enter the video embed screen by choosing "`</>` Embed" under the Media Actions drop-down menu.
\\
\\
\\
In the Embed screen, select the tab labeled "For Email Marketing".  Choose "MailChimp" from the Email provider drop-down.  Then tweak your settings for thumbnail size (how big it will appear in the email) and landing page (once they click on the thumbnail, where should they go? - hint: where the video is!).
\\
\\
*TIP:* Our thumbnail default size of 450px is the same as MailChimp and looks great in most email software.  If you'd like to test a different size, use "pop-up preview" in MailChimp after pasting in a revised Merge Tag.
\\
\\
*NOTE:* Using a project with an email marketing campaign means it will become a "public project".  You may be prompted to make this change if you haven't previously.
\\
\\

**Step 3: Paste Your Merge Tag Into MailChimp**\\
`<style float-right>`{{:mc_3b.png|}}`</style>`
After getting the thumbnail and link settings working the way you'd like, copy the "Video Merge Tag" code, and paste it into the body of your MailChimp email.
\\
\\
*Tip:* I normally send myself a test, to make sure everything is working correctly.
\\
\\

**Step 4: Start Tracking Viewing!**\\
`<style float-right>`{{:mc_4b.png|}}`</style>`
\\
Once your viewers receive their emails, they will start clicking your video!  
\\
The great part about MailChimp and Wistia together is that the merge tag has your recipient's email address built in - so when tracking the stats you can see exactly which emails watched the video, and up to the second how much they watched.  Now how cool is that? Make sure you check in the "Public and Embed Stats" for the viewing stats.
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
`<style float-right>`{{:mc_5b.png|}}`</style>`
\\
\\
*Tip:* If you would like to keep the email campaign separate from the other embedded viewings of the video, set up a separate project specifically for the email version of the video.

#### Posting as a Status Update on Facebook

Facebook is an important part of any marketers life these days.  At Wistia, we're continually trying to incorporate more Facebook functionality into our video sharing.
\\
\\
`<style float-right>`{{:facebook_wistia2.png|}}`</style>`To embed your video into Facebook, follow these steps:**
 1.  Go to the page with the video you'd like to share on Facebook. Under the Media Actions menu, select "share by link".
 2.  Copy the share link, paste it into your Facebook status box and click "share".
 3.  Your friends will be able to see the video in their News Feed, and even play it within the Feed - how neat is that!?
\\
\\

**Advanced Tip:** if you would like a description to show up with the video in the feed, add a [Sidebar Element]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/managing_projects_media_and_contacts#how_to_add_a_description_to_your_project.html) to your video.  The embed action will automatically pull it in to the status feed!
\\
\\
\\
\\

#### Posting as a Twitter "Tweet"

`<style float-left>`{{:twitter-logo.png}}`</style>`
\\
\\
Posting content on Twitter is becoming one of the best ways to encourage rapid sharing of the content.
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\

**Step 1: Get the URL to Share**\\
`<style float-right>`{{:share_link.png?400}}`</style>`
\\
\\
\\
Once you have the video to share, get the public URL by selecting "Share by Link" from under the green "Media Actions" drop-down menu.  Select the entire URL and copy it.
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\

**Step 2: Compose your Tweet**\\
`<style float-right>`{{:twitter_bar.png?400}}`</style>`
\\
Now open up your favorite Twitter client for posting.  Compose the tweet you want to send out, and then paste in the URL for the video.  Now you can easily send out a message to all your brand followers!
\\
\\
\\
*Tip:* 140 character limit got you down? Save some valuable real estate by using our link shortening tool: replace the part of your URL that includes your Wistia address ('yourname.wistia.com') with 'wi.st'!
\\

\\
#### Share Your Video in Person

`<style float-right>`{{:ipadview.png}}`</style>`
\\
\\
One of the best ways to connect with potential customers and get quick customer feedback is in person, at trade shows or conventions.  With Wistia, bringing video with you to show off is a snap - just pull up your Wistia account on an iPhone, iPad, or other mobile device.
