# Using SSL Embeds

The SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, protocol makes communications transported over the Internet even more secure.  For our clients that want to embed video on HTTPS pages, but want to avoid those pesky security warnings, we've created SSL embedding.

To enable SSL embeds, give us a shout at `<support@wistia.com>`, and we will enable your account.  From there, your embed screen will include an extra checkbox for SSL embed codes.
