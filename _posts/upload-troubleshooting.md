## Clear your browser's cache

While it may seem like a rudimentary solution, this can often be the simplest way to cure your ailing     uploads. Since our uploader is built upon flash, it relies on your browser's cache to transfer the file into your Wistia account. When the cache gets clogged, it can interfere with this transfer and cause some wonkiness with your upload. The cache (or temporary internet files) can be cleared in the following locations:

  * **Chrome** *Preferences --> Browsing data* 
  * **Safari** *Preferences --> Privacy Settings*
  * **Firefox** *Tools --> Clear recent history*
  * **Internet Explorer** *Tools --> Internet Options --> Browsing History*

## Make sure your flash plugin is up to date

Flash updates their plugin on a pretty regular basis, so we always recommend making sure you have the latest version of flash to ensure a smooth upload experience. You can visit this page to update to the latest version: [Adobe Flash Downloads Page](http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html).

## Try our simple uploader

Sometimes the flash uploader just won't be co-operative, which is why we have our [HTML5 uploader]({{ '/simple-uploader' | post_url }}). Using this uploader can prevent the download from crashing due to flash. While this doesn't provide a progress bar (or the ability to que files for upload) it is more stable and can handle files larger than 2GB. 

## Reset your internet connection

Some say it's the oldest trick in the book, but when it comes to connection issues it can be a lifesaver. Try resetting your router and making sure you have a secure connection; a shaky connection can be a nightmare when trying to upload (especially for larger files).
