## Clear Your Browser's Cache

While it may seem like a rudimentary solution, this can often be the simplest way to cure your ailing     uploads. Since our uploader is built upon flash, it relies on your browser's cache to transfer the file into your Wistia account. When the cache gets clogged, it can interfere with this transfer and cause some wonkiness with your upload. The cache (or temporary internet files) can be cleared in the following locations:

  * **Chrome** *Preferences --> Browsing data*
  * **Safari** *Preferences --> Privacy Settings*
  * **Firefox** *Tools --> Clear recent history*
  * **Internet Explorer** *Tools --> Internet Options --> Browsing History*

## Is Your Browser is Up-to-Date?

Some older browsers don't support HTML5 uploads (which is what we use). Make
sure you [update that browser](http://browsehappy.com/) for the best experience.

## Try Our Backup Uploader

Maybe it's time to try our Backup Uploader instead. Just a heads up, this upload
 process doesn't show a progress bar.

The Backup Uploader can be accessed by adding `?backup_uploader` to a Project
URL.

So from a project URL like `https://support.wistia.com/projects/qdybaq78y0`, you'd
navigate to `https://support.wistia.com/projects/qdybaq78y0?backup_uploader` to
get to the backup uploader.

## Reset Your Internet Connection

Some say it's the oldest trick in the book, but when it comes to connection issues it can be a lifesaver. Try resetting your router and making sure you have a secure connection; a shaky connection can be a nightmare when trying to upload (especially for larger files).
