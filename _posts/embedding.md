## Pre-Embedding

Once you've [uploaded]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) and [customized]({{ '/customizing-your-video' | post_url }}) your video, you're ready to go ahead and embed. Huzzah!

Fun fact: even after you embed a video on your website, you can make changes to it in [Customize]({{ '/customizing-your-video' | post_url }}). Those changes will automatically apply anywhere your video is embedded. If you want to use _different_ customizations across multiple embeds of the same video, you can [make multiple copies of the video]({{ '/media#moving_and_copying_media' | post_url }}) or use advanced [embed options]({{ '/embed-options' | post_url }}) in your embed codes.

## Generate an Embed Code

An **embed code** is a snippet of code that you can use to add content (like a video!) to a web page.

To generate an embed code for your video, start by selecting the *Embed & Share* option under the <span class='action_menu'>Video Actions</span> menu from your video's page in Wistia. That will open the Embed & Share screen, where you can choose your embed code type and fine-tune it for your page.

There are two main types of Wistia embed codes: [Inline embeds](#inline_embeds) and [Popover embeds](#popover_embeds). Read on to learn more about both!

## Inline Embeds

{% post_image hashed_id: '8b09b21713e40f738d70a43d66bac82acef32d51', width: 711, class: 'float_left' %}

Inline embeds will place the video directly on the page, inline with the rest of your content. Here's an example "Standard" inline embed:

{% wistia_embed hashed_id: vud7ff4i6w %}

This is what a standard inline embed code looks like:

{% codeblock standard_embed.html %}
<script charset="ISO-8859-1" src="//fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>
<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_j38ihh83m5" style="height:349px;width:620px">&nbsp;</div>
{% endcodeblock %}


Feel free to grab that embed code to try it out, or [go to your Wistia account](https://my.wistia.com) and get an inline embed code for you own video!

{{ 'Wistia embeds are extremely configurable, and lots of fun to work with (if we may say so ourselves). If you want to get fancy with our JavaScript API üíÉ, [this link is for you](http://wistia.com/doc/player-api).' | tip }}


### Fallback (iframe) Embed

While the Standard inline embed code will work great in most cases, some websites can give it a little trouble. Luckily, there's a fallback option:

{% post_image hashed_id: 'edf435f5c6927c7995943836170af3654b45ace5', width: 641, class: 'float_left' %}

The Fallback embed is like a [Subaru Impreza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Impreza): simple, reliable, and if you ask the Wistian writing this help page, a pretty nice way to get from point A to point B.

{% wistia_embed hashed_id: sztcrbdhr2, embedType: iframe %}

If you can't include JavaScript on your website, or something is making your Standard embed look a little... weird, give the Fallback option a try.

Here's an example of a fallback inline embed code:

{% codeblock %}
<iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/avk9twrrbn" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="620" height="349"></iframe>
<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>
{% endcodeblock %}

{{ "The Fallback embed should only be used if the Standard inline embed won't work on your website for some strange reason. Please [tell us](http://wistia.com/support/contact) if that happens!" | alert }}


## Popover Embeds

{% post_image hashed_id: 'f8dea5aa0d84cafac432a23ee982f66cff819d0e', width: 711, class: 'float_left' %}

Popover embed codes make your videos _pop over_ the rest of your content instead of playing inline.

You can launch a popover video with either a text link or thumbnail image. When clicked, that link will open a lightbox
with your video inside. Here's an example of a popover embed using the thumbnail option:

<script charset="ISO-8859-1" src="//fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_k9bmbixozg popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:169px;width:300px">&nbsp;</div>

And here's the popover embed code behind that video:

{% codeblock popover_example.html %}
<script charset="ISO-8859-1" src="//fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>
<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_pukozq6xf0 popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:169px;width:300px">&nbsp;</div>
{% endcodeblock %}

Copy and paste that into your website to give it a try! Be sure to read the section on [Responsive Design with Popover Embeds](#responsive_design_with_popover_embeds) as well.

{{ 'If you would like to modify the behavior of your popover embed beyond what the options in the Embed & Share screen provide, check out the [Popover Customization](http://wistia.com/doc/popover-customization) page.' | tip }}


## Embedding Responsively

Responsive videos are happy videos. Responsiveness works a bit differently for inline embeds and popover embeds, so let's dig into both separately here üëá.

### Responsive Design with Inline Embeds

Inline embed codes are responsive by default, meaning that your video will automatically resize itself to the width of its container. Hooray!

With a responsive embed, you will never need to manually adjust the dimensions of your embed code. If the video isn't quite the right size, try adjusting the width of its parent container on your webpage first. If you get stuck, just [reach out to our Customer Happiness team](http://wistia.com/support/contact)!

If you need to set the video to specific dimensions though and don't want it to be responsive at all, just switch to the Fixed Size option and choose a width or height. The dimension you _don't_ adjust will automatically change to maintain the aspect ratio of your video.

{% wistia_embed hashed_id: eas86njrhu %}

That's it!



### Responsive Design with Popover Embeds

With popover embeds, there are two separate things to consider:

1. The responsiveness of the thumbnail image (unless you're using a text link).
2. The responsiveness of the video itself, when it's "popped over" the page.

The thumbnail of a popover embed is not responsive by default. But if you want it responsive, that's as easy as clicking the "Responsive" checkbox:

{% post_image hashed_id: 'dcabfde7cb81a82df4d0452a51901c6752e73faa', width: 318, class: 'float_left' %}

That's all it takes to make the thumbnail responsive. Wahoo!

The video component of a popover embed _is_ responsive by default. Since the videos "pops" over the rest of the page, it doesn't have to worry about bumping into anything else. It will automatically fill up most of the page, leaving some comfortable space between the video and the edges of the browser window.


## Video SEO

Video SEO is a set of tools and processes to help search engines identify and index your videos. Wistia's Standard embed codes are automatically SEO-friendly, and they'll help people find your videos on _your_ website ‚Äì not [someone else's](http://youtube.com).

Check out the [Video SEO help page]({{ '/video-seo' | post_url }}) for more detail üîç and tips on getting Video SEO done right.


## Link in Email Campaign

{% post_image hashed_id: 'ee7a753cc27e7b92a403ee67a58311b4e9415c9e', width: 711, class: 'float_left' %}

Email is a great way to share your videos and re-engage with your growing audience. And Wistia's email marketing tools make it easy! See the [Email Marketing]({{ '/email-marketing' | post_url }}) page for details.

## Social Sharing

{% post_image hashed_id: 'dc8a6f34c8474f8e7f37e3b8a894ad2e4b4269f6', width: 711, class: 'float_left' %}

Would you like to share your videos on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter? You're in luck! To learn more about doing that with Wistia, check out the [Social Sharing]({{ '/social-sharing' | post_url }}) page.


## Protecting Your Embeds

Want to make sure your videos can only be played on _your_ website (and of course, within your Wistia account)? Check out [Domain Restrictions]({{ '/account-setup#domain_restrictions' | post_url }}) for that. For more information on keeping your videos secure, see the [Security]({{ '/security' | post_url }}) guide.


## Embedded Video Stats

Now that your video is embedded on your webpage, you can use Wistia's
analytics to see how your viewers are interacting with the content.

[Read up on Wistia's analytics functionality]({{ '/embedded-video-analytics' | post_url }}).
