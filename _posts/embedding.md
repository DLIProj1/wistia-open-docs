## Upload Your Video

{% post_image hashed_id: '5695b32b1de5048682ee2cbc2fe2aec94f70c771', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

The first step is uploading the video you want on your website to Wistia. *Already done that? Move to embedding!*

To upload your video, open the Project where you want the video to end up.

Select the *Upload Media* option from under the <span class="action_menu">Project Actions</span> menu.

Check out our [guide to uploading]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) for more information

After uploading is complete, Wistia encodes several versions of the video - perfect for serving on multiple browsers and mobile devices.  Once these versions are complete, it is ready to be embedded onto your site.

## Generate the Embed Code

**Embed codes** are snippets of code pasted on your web page that are useful for serving up content (i.e. video).  To generate the embed code for your video, start by selecting the *&lt;/&gt; Embed* option under the <span class='action_menu'>Media Actions</span> menu.

<div class='clear'></div>

{% post_image hashed_id: 'edda8e48e886fbfc42a8a6b6d0264fbbe160afd6', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

Clicking this option will take you to the Wistia Embed Screen.  This is where you can make some basic changes to the look and feel of your video presentation.

<div class='clear'></div>

{% post_image hashed_id: 'fbe53b9002062e623f346aaaf7c850d33b0cd5dc', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

See our [complete guide to the embed screen]({{ '/embed-screen' | post_url }}) for more info.  Once you have all the settings set the way you would like them, copy the embed code from the top box.

## Pasting your Embed Code onto Your Page

Once you have copied the embed code, the next step is to paste it into your web page editor (which could be a CMS, blog, HTML document, etc.) This is where it gets complicated to talk in specifics, since each website management system is different, but here are some tips:

*Tips for Embedding Video the Fun Way*

  1. If you are using a CMS, make sure the settings will allow for *javascript* and will leave *HTML* alone, where possible.
  2. Choose the *HTML* editor setting where possible - not the *Visual* editor.
  3. Leave a line above and below your embed code, to make sure it doesn't conflict with other elements on the page.

Now that your video is embedded on your webpage, you can use Wistia's tracking analytics to see how your viewers are interacting with the content.

Start by selecting "Stats" from under the <span class="action_menu">Media Actions</span> menu.

<div class="clear"></div>

{% post_image hashed_id: '5fd2f185054f9b835d27c66ff94f3027c9729c2b', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

On the video embed stats page, you can see the detailed tracking statistics for each video.

The overall interaction graph shows you how viewers are tuning in and out of your video on aggregate.

The individual heatmaps below show each individual viewing instance, right down to the second.
