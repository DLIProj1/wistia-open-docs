title: Using SSL Embeds
description: If your domain is set up in https then regular embed codes might trigger an error message. We provide an SSL option for your embeds to fit in nicely with your https domain.

The SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, protocol makes communications transported over the Internet even more secure.  For our clients that want to embed video on HTTPS pages, but want to avoid those pesky security warnings, we've created SSL embedding.  You need SSL embedding if your URL begins with 'https'.

**Note:** You cannot use SSL in tandem with our [domain restrictions](/domain-restrictions.html) feature.

To use SSL with your embeds, check the "Use SSL" option in the Advanced Embed Types area of your SuperEmbed Builder.
