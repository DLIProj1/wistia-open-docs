## Using the SD Card

Your GoPro uses an SD card to store the videos you record. You can eject the
SD card from your GoPro, and plug it into your computer to import your video.

First, find the microSD card on the side of the GoPro, and press in on it to
eject it. Then you can pull it out, and place in a microSD adapter for plugging
into your computer.

Once you have the SD card in the adapter, plug it in to your computer (some
Apple laptops come with an SD card slot, you might have to purchase additional
connectors.)

Once the card is plugged in, it will appear as a drive on your desktop.

Navigate to find the file on the SD card (it might be in a folder labeled
`DCIM`) and drag it to your desktop.

Once they are on your desktop (or in any folder) you can [upload them as usual]({{ 'upload-video' | post_url }}).

## Using the USB Cable Connector

If you don't have an adapter, or an SD card reader, you can also use the USB
cable provided with your GoPro to import video. Plug the cable into your GoPro
and computer USB port, and make sure your GoPro is turned on!

Open iPhoto on your Mac (or similar photo import software for PC). It should
detect the GoPro as an external device, and launch the importing process.

Select the videos you want to import, and (in the case of iPhoto), select *Import Selected*.

Once they are imported, you can drag them to your desktop, and [upload them as usual]({{ 'upload-video' | post_url }}).

**So that's it!** Enjoy using your GoPro and Wistia.

And now, a pancake flip.
