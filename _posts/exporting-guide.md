## Final Cut Pro

There are three ways to export video for use on Wistia from Final Cut Pro: 

* using QuickTime conversion, using Compressor as a standalone application, or 
* sending from Final Cut Pro to Compressor.

### Using QuickTime conversion

When we are making videos, we export them from Final Cut Pro using QuickTime 
conversion. Select a clip or sequence in the Browser or open a sequence in the 
Timeline, then choose *File &gt; Export &gt;* Using QuickTime Conversion. 

Choose a name and location for the file. From the Format pop-up menu choose 
QuickTime Movie. Choose Default Settings from the Use pop-up menu and click Save. 
Your video will be saved to your computer as a MOV file which you can then 
easily [upload]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) to Wistia.

Here's a quick guide from Chris on exporting in FCP using Quicktime conversion:

### Using Compressor as a standalone application

To use Compressor as a standalone application, you must first create a QuickTime 
movie file to submit to Compressor. Since this will only be a temporary 
intermediate file, we recommend creating a QuickTime reference movie, which can 
be created quicker and takes up less space than a standard QuickTime movie 
because the video refers to your sequence's original media files when possible 
instead of storing all of the media in the file itself. However, since this file 
simply references other media stored on your computer, it will not work on other
computers that don't have all the required media.

To create a QuickTime reference movie, select the sequence or clip in the Browser 
that you want to export and choose *File &gt; Export &gt;* QuickTime Movie. 

Choose a name and location for the file. Choose Current Settings and include 
both Audio and Video. Markers does not matter, as they will not be included in 
your final Wistia video. Make sure the Make Movie Self-Contained box is unchecked 
and click Save. Then follow the directions for exporting video from Compressor.

### Final Cut Pro to Compressor

You can also send a movie to Compressor by exporting a Browser clip or sequence 
directly from Final Cut Pro to Compressor. Exporting a video from Final Cut Pro 
to Compressor works nearly the same as using Compressor as a standalone 
application (above), the only difference being that you can skip the intermediate 
step of creating a QuickTime movie.

To send a sequence or clip from Final Cut Pro to Compressor, select the sequence 
or clip in the Browser and choose *File &gt; Send To &gt; Compressor*. 

Compressor will open and you will see the sequence or clip appear in a Compressor 
Batch window. In the Settings tab, drag the MPEG-4 setting from Apple/Formats to 
the job in the Batch window. Choose where the video will be saved by dragging a 
destination preset from the Destinations tab to your job in the Batch window. 

Click Submit in the Batch window. The video will be encoded as an MP4 file which 
you can then easily [upload]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) to Wistia.

## Adobe Premiere Pro

To export a video from Adobe Premiere Pro for use in Wistia, place your video 
clip in the Premiere timeline. Choose *File &gt; Export &gt; Adobe Media Encoder*. 

The Export Settings window will appear. 

Choose QuickTime from the Format drop-down menu. Click OK. Choose a filename and 
location. Your video will be saved to your computer as a MOV file which you can 
then easily [upload]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) to Wistia.

---

## Adobe Captivate

To export a file from Adobe Captivate, select 'Publish' from under the File menu.  
In the Publish dialogue box, select `Media`. 

Select `H.264` or `MP4` as the format for export.  

If prompted to enter a title, enter one without the full file extension 
(this will be added automatically).

---

## Camtasia

Camtasia comes with preset production options to make export easier. 
With the project you wish to share open in Camtasia Studio, click the 
*Produce and Share* button. On the first page of the Production Wizard, choose 
Web from the drop down menu, and click `Next`. 

Give your video a name and destination and click `Finish`. The video will be 
rendered in a MP4 file which you can then easily [upload]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) to Wistia.

If you are not satisfied with the quality of the video produced using Camtasia's 
given presets, you can increase the quality in two ways. Whenever you first 
place a screencast in Camtasia's timeline you are asked to choose what 
dimensions you want to edit the video in. 

Larger dimensions allow you to watch the video at a bigger size without losing 
quality. You can also adjust the quality by using the custom production settings
 in the Production Wizard (*Produce and Share button &gt; Custom production 
settings &gt; Next &gt; MP4/FLV/SWF â€“ Flash Output &gt; Next &gt; Flash Options button &gt; Video tab*).

## Exporting from Compressor

To encode a QuickTime movie using Compressor for playback on Wistia, you must create an encoding job. In Compressor, choose Job &gt; New Job With File. Select the media file you wish to use and click Open. An encoding job for the selected media file appears in the Batch window. In the Settings tab, drag the MPEG-4 setting from Apple/Formats to the job in the Batch window. If you want, you can change the name and destination of the encoded file, or just leave them the same as the source file. Click Submit in the Batch window. The video will be encoded as an MP4 file which you can then easily [upload]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) to Wistia.

## Final Cut X

{% post_image hashed_id: '9462a250be482463bfc2f6015279b6642e66f643', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

Exporting from Final Cut X is similar to iMovie export.  To reach the Export Menu, 
select `Export` from under the `Share` drop-down menu.

From the file format drop-down, select the `H.264` codec.  
Click *Next*, and save the file in a useful location.

{{ "If you are using the 'Chapters' functionality in FCP X, you'll need to disable them before exporting, or the upload won't work." | note }}

## After Effects

If you are adding your After Effects export back into an editor like Avid or 
Final Cut (our normal workflow), match the native sequence settings you are using 
in your edit.  
Make sure you match codec (*ProRes, ProRes LT, HDV*), frame size (*1920x1080, 1440x1080*), 
and frame rate (*24, 23.98, 29.97*).

If you are exporting out of After Effects for upload to Wistia, 
use *h.264 quicktime settings* and *1280x720* frame size.

## Garageband

To export your video + audio track/score from Garageband, start by clicking on 
the Share option and selecting "Export movie to disk."

You will then be prompted with a dropdown menu for Video Settings. Select 
*Expert Setting* and click the export button (this will let you customize the 
video for optimal uploading into Wistia). 

The video will begin to export, and another menu will then pop up on your screen. 
Here, make sure you select *Movie to MPEG-4* under the Export menu and *Default Settings*
under the *Use* menu. 

Click on the *Options* button to the right to enter some custom quality settings.
 Here's a screenshot of our recommended settings:

{% post_image hashed_id: '29ce51ada909d468e784451e7cbe81b779814502', class: 'align-center', width: 580 %}

Your video will be saved to your computer as an mp4 file that you can easily 
upload into your Wistia account.

## iMovie

To export your iMovie video project, select the project you wish to export from 
the iMovie Project Library and choose *Share &gt; Export Movie*.

{% post_image hashed_id: 'd9fed1664fce966debccdefec84b9f564a94d6cb', class: 'center' %}

You will be prompted to select the size that you want your video to be exported at.  
For situations where most users will be viewing the video within your Wistia 
page, a 'medium size' video will work perfectly.  

If you are confident that most of your viewers will be using higher-speed internet 
connections, or if you would like to display the video at a larger resolution 
on your web page, a 'large size' video will work well.

Choose a filename and location, and click Export. Your video will be saved to 
your computer as an M4V file which you can then easily [upload]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) to your Wistia account.

## QuickTime Pro

{% post_image hashed_id: '42d2696efddb067ca8e238212444c6c19eff923a', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

To easily export a video from QuickTime Pro, open the movie you wish to export
and choose *File &gt; Export*. In the Export pop-up menu, select `Movie to QuickTime Movie`,
which exports your video as a MOV file. Choose Default Settings from the Use pop-up menu, choose a filename and location, and click Save. Your video will be saved to your computer as a MOV file which you can then easily [upload]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) to Wistia.

## ScreenFlow

{% post_image hashed_id: 'e2ea358871e38d394195c6a207cdd648b1296914', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

To export a screencast from ScreenFlow, open the screen recording you wish to 
export and choose *File &gt; Export*. From the Preset pop-up menu, choose 
`Web - High (Best Quality)`. 

For the dimensions, make it scale by 100% so that your viewers will be able to 
see the details of your screen as clearly as possible. Choose a filename and 
location, and click `Export`. Your video will be saved to your computer as an 
MOV file which you can then easily [upload]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) to Wistia.

## Handbrake

Handbrake is a great free solution for smoothing out problems with weird video files.
To export a video for Wistia from Handbrake, click *Source* in the top right 
corner and select the file that you'd like to convert. Some of the fields will 
auto-populate. We recommend making sure that:

* The "Video Codec" on the video tab is set to *H.264 (x264)*

* The "Video Quality" uses "Average Bitrate" and is set to around 3000kbps, or whatever the maximum bitrate of your video is if it's lower. Also, you can check off "2-pass encoding."

* On the "Audio" tab, use the "AAC (CoreAudio)" codec and set the bitrate to at least 128 kbps, or the maximum bitrate for the audio track in your video.

* In the top right, click "Picture Settings" and make sure the aspect ratio is correct.

Then, click "Start" at the top right and your video will begin encoding to the 
Destination folder you chose!
