## Final Cut Pro X

There are three ways to export video for use on Wistia from Final Cut Pro:

* [Sharing from Final Cut Pro](#sharing_from_final_cut_pro),
* [using Compressor as a standalone application](#using_compressor_as_a_standalone_application), or
* sending from [Final Cut Pro to Compressor](#final_cut_pro_to_compressor).

To make things even easier, we've also put together an awesome
[Wistia preset](#the_wistia_final_cut_pro_preset) for you to download. We know.
You're welcome. :)

### Sharing From Final Cut Pro X

{% wistia_embed hashed_id: 931387hlwv %}

Exporting videos for Wistia from Final Cut Pro is pretty straightforward.

First, select a clip or sequence in the Browser, or open a sequence in the Timeline.
From there choose **File** > **Share** > **Export File**.

If **Export File** isn't in the **Share** list, you'll have to add it as a destination.
Go to **File** > **Share** > **Add Destination**. Once here, double click
 **Export File** in the list of options and close the window.

In the Export File menu, under **Settings**, change the format from Video & Audio
to **Computer**. This will change the codec to an H.264 MP4 file. (AKA, Wistia's favorite
setting.)

Next, make sure the resolution is set to **1080p**, and that the Video Codec is
set to **Better Quality** and not Faster Encode.

Then, click **Next**, and choose where you want this file to export to. After it's
done exporting, you're good to upload it to Wistia. Look at you go!


### Using Compressor as a standalone application

To use Compressor as a standalone application, you must first create a QuickTime
movie file to submit to Compressor. Since this will only be a temporary
intermediate file, we recommend creating a QuickTime reference movie. These can
be created quicker and takes up less space than a standard QuickTime movie. This
is because the video refers to your sequence's original media files when possible,
instead of storing all of the media in the file itself. However, since this file
simply references other media stored on your computer, it will not work on other
computers that don't have all the required media.

To create a QuickTime reference movie, select the sequence or clip in the Browser
that you want to export and choose **File** > **Export** > **QuickTime Movie**.

Choose a name and location for the file. Choose **Current Settings** and include
both Audio and Video. Make sure the *Make Movie Self-Contained* box is unchecked
and click **Save**. Then follow the directions for exporting video from Compressor.

### Final Cut Pro to Compressor

{% wistia_embed hashed_id: s84nyir64o %}

You can also send a video to Compressor by exporting a Browser clip or sequence
directly from Final Cut Pro to Compressor. Exporting a video from Final Cut Pro
to Compressor works nearly the same as [using Compressor as a standalone application](#using_compressor_as_a_standalone_application),
but you can skip the intermediate step of creating a QuickTime movie.

To send a sequence or clip from Final Cut Pro to Compressor, select the sequence
or clip in the Browser and choose **File** > **Send To** > **Compressor**.

Compressor will open and you will see the sequence (or clip) appear in a Compressor
Batch window. Create a new custom setting, and under **File Format**,
choose **Quicktime Export Components**.

Set the destination of your file, and then change the Encoder Type to **MP4**.

Then, under **Advanced Settings**, head into **Configure** (this launches a modal).
Choose **MP4** as the file format and change the video format to **H.264**.

Bump the image size up to **1080p**, update the data range to **15,000 kbps**, and keep the
frame rate at current. In the **Audio** section, change the Data Rate to **256 kbps**, and
the sample rate to **48k**.

Save these settings, and drag your new Custom Preset to the queued video.

Then click **Start Batch**. This will be encoded as an MP4 file that looks great and
is ready to [upload]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) to Wistia.

###The Wistia Final Cut Pro Preset

If you haven't already, [download The Wistia Preset for Compressor](https://support.wistia.com/medias/0trd5956ed/download?media_file_id=80944519).
It's a custom preset we've made for exporting 1080p videos, that look and upload
great to Wistia.

Once it's downloaded, in drag the preset into the Compressor settings window.
This will add the preset to your list of custom presets. Then just drag the
Wistia Preset setting to the job in the Batch window, and click submit. The
video will be encoded as an MP4 file which you can then easily upload to Wistia.
Hooray!

## Camtasia Studio (PC)

Camtasia comes with preset production options to make export easier, but sometimes these settings aren't always ideal. Have no fear! Trevor's here to help. ðŸ“¼

{% wistia_embed hashed_id: b0t7ndy3zq %}

Within the project you wish to share open in Camtasia Studio, head up to **File** >
**Produce and Share**. On the first page of the Production Wizard, choose the **Custom Production Settings** preset.

Confirm that the File Format is set to **MP4** and then click next. In the **Size** menu, make sure to set the dimensions to 1920x1080, and check **Keep Aspect Ratio**.

Under **Video Settings**, change the encoding mode to Bitrate, and change the quality to **15,000 kbps**.

## After Effects

If you are adding your After Effects export back into an editor like Avid or Premiere
(our normal workflow), match the native sequence settings you are using in your edit.
Make sure you match codec (ProRes, ProRes LT, HDV), frame size (1920x1080, 1440x1080),
and frame rate (24, 23.98, 29.97).

If you are exporting out of After Effects for upload to Wistia, use h.264 Quicktime
settings and 1920x1080 frame size.

## Handbrake

Handbrake is a great, free solution for smoothing out problems with weird video files.
To export a video for Wistia from Handbrake, click *Source* in the top right
corner and select the file that you'd like to convert. Some of the fields will
auto-populate. We recommend making sure that:

* The "Video Codec" on the video tab is set to *H.264 (x264)*
* The "Video Quality" uses "Average Bitrate" and is set to around 3000kbps, or whatever the maximum bitrate of your video is if it's lower. Also, you can check off "2-pass encoding."
* On the "Audio" tab, use the "AAC (CoreAudio)" codec and set the bitrate to at least 128 kbps, or the maximum bitrate for the audio track in your video.
* In the top right, click "Picture Settings" and make sure the aspect ratio is correct.

Then, click "Start" at the top right and your video will begin encoding to the
Destination folder you chose!

## GoToMeeting

Getting high-quality video out of GoToMeeting (or GoToWebinar / GoToTraining)
is tricky tricky, but luckily our friend Kyle from HubSpot has come to the
rescue with a great workflow to convert your GoToMeeting to *WMV format*.

{% post_image hashed_id: '4a96c6faef3058addf78bdffbfa5cad0204cb2e9', class: 'right', width: 320 %}

Start by opening your GoToMeeting *Preferences* (screenshot is for Windows, as
the Mac version doesn't convert to WMV).

{% post_image hashed_id: 'c503b74b25048612defae000902ebc577c716f4d', class: 'center' %}

In the *Recording* preference category, select *convert to Windows Media Player
file*.

And that is it! Your WMV will encode at much higher quality after being
uploaded to Wistia than the default G2M4 video. If you have any trouble, check
out the [GoToMeeting Transcoding Wizard](http://support.citrixonline.com/en_US/GoToMeeting/knowledge_articles/000081292?title=Using+The+GoToMeeting+Transcoding+Wizard%7D).
