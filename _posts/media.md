## Upload Video

Before you can do anything awesome with your videos, you have to upload them! 

Check out the [uploading documentation]({{ '/upload-video' | post_url }}) for
more info on uploading.

## Update Video Title

The title of the Media is how you will find it in your Account.  By default,
the title is the name of the media you uploaded, but can be updated anytime 
(doesn't have to be set before uploading). Changing the title of the video won't
affect embed codes or links, either.

{% post_image hashed_id: 'ef21edd3c495688fb104d461e202109812afce5a', class: 'center' %}

To edit the title, hover over it with your mouse, and click the 
<span class="edit_tag"></span> tag. Edit the title text, and press the 
<span class="code">return</span> key to finish editing.

## Change the Thumbnail

Changing the thumbnail of your video is covered in detail in the [Customize documentation]({{ '/customize-your-video' | post_url }}).

## Embed Video

The ins-and-outs of embedding your video is the subject of our 
[embedding documentation]({{ '/embedding' | post_url }}).

## Downloading Media 

By default, contacts invited into Wistia are not permitted to download your
media files. A contact's ability to download files is controlled via 
permissions at the project level. 

To adjust a contact's permissions for a particular project, go into that 
project and choose *Manage Viewers* from the
<span class="action_menu">Project Actions</span> menu.

There is more on giving download permissions in the [private sharing]({{ '/private-sharing' | post_url}})
documentation.

## Timecoded Comments

Timecoded comments allow the user to link a comment on a video to a particular 
time in the video.  The timecode is captured and stored with the comment such 
that when another user views the comment, they can click on the time code, the 
video will skip directly to the point in the video where the comment was made.

### How to make a timecoded comment

To make a timecoded comment, pause the video at the time to which you wish the 
comment to be linked.  Then, simply check the box next to the Post Comment button 
which says *Link comment to current time in video*.

Once the box is checked and the comment has been written, click the 
<span class="faux_button">Post comment</span> and your comment will be saved.

### Delete Comment

To delete comments, hover over the comment you'd like to delete, and the trash
can icon will appear. Select the trash can to remove the comment permanently.

### Can I turn off comments for videos and other media?

Yes. Comments can be disabled for each video. The [Customize documentation]({{ '/customizing-your-video' | post_url }}) 
covers this in further detail.

## Video Description

To add a description to your video, hover your mouse under the Media title.
Click the *Add a Description* text that appears.

{% post_image hashed_id: '7123835d053afbb27a3408f292348575f5dfe8f6', class: 'center' %}

Descriptions are most helpful for sharing links to view video in your Wistia
account (where viewers need additional context). Your video description will
also be passed through to services like Facebook ([see more on social sharing]({{ '/social-sharing' | post_url }})). 

## Copy Media

Copy media is good for creating multiple instances of a video with different
customizations, or for zero-ing out stats for a certain video (i.e. you make a
copy and then re-embed).

Navigate to the project you want the copied video **to end up in**. Under
the <span class="action_menu">Project Actions</span> menu, choose the *Copy Media* option.

{% post_image hashed_id: 'f456efce4482b9e6f129e0c89f58daa653bcf92d', class: 'center' %}

This will open up the *Copy Media* panel in the right-hand sidebar.  From the 
drop-down menu in the Copy Media panel, choose the project from which you wish 
to copy media.  Once the project is selected in the Copy Media panel, all of the 
media from that project will be displayed below the drop down box.

Select the media in the Copy Media panel to copy it to the current project.
