# Building a Rating System for Your Video in Wistia

Using the [Sidebar Elements]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/http://wistia.com/doc/managing_projects_media_and_contacts#how_to_add_a_description_to_your_video.html) feature in Wistia and a survey tool like [Polldaddy]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/http://polldaddy.com.html), you can build a star rating system for your library of videos in Wistia.
\\
\\
### Step 1: Choose Your Video

`<style float-right>`{{:pic_1_2.png|}}`</style>`Let's get started.  First, we'll select a video to get the ratings for.  Let's say we've got a new Wistia video snack and we'd like to have everyone on the team rate it before we send it out.  I just happen to have one handy!

### Step 2: Load Up Your Poll Tool

`<style float-right>`{{:pic_2_2.png|}}`</style>`Here at Wistia, we use a lot of different poll tools.  For this type of simply ratings system, I like [Polldaddy]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/http://polldaddy.com.html).  Once you've logged in, open up "Ratings" and create a new ratings widget.  Here, you can control the name of the report and style the ratings system.
Now that you have created your rating, grab the javascript embed code.

### Step 3: Create the Sidebar Element

`<style float-right>`{{:pic_5_2.png|}}`</style>`Back in your Wistia account, create a new description Sidebar Element using the "Media Actions" drop-down menu.  Once created, click the "Advanced" button, and then open the HTML editor using the "Source" button.  Paste the javascript embed code from the rating tool into the Sidebar Element HTML editor and click the "save" button.
