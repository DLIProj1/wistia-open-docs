# Your First Days With Wistia

So you've got your account all set up, and you're ready to get started using Wistia.  Now what?  Our *First Days With Wistia* guides will make sure you can take advantage of our functionality out of the gate.

# How to upload a video to Wistia


Videos must be uploaded inside a project.  

Either create a new project by selecting "New Project" from the Projects drop down menu on any page or click into an existing project where you would like to upload the video.  

{{:upload-select.png?161 |}} 
\\
\\

Next, hover over the "Project Actions" menu and select "Upload Media".  

A dialog will then be shown which allows you to choose the file to upload from your local computer.  To upload multiple media at once, hold down the shift or ctrl buttons while browsing.
\\
\\
\\
\\
Once a file has been chosen, you will see the progress of the file uploading as in the image below.

If you are having trouble with uploads completing, please try our [simple uploader without the progress bar]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/simple-uploader.html).
\\
For instructions on the best way to encode your video prior to uploading it, check our [video exporting page]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/exporting.html).

Once you have uploaded your videos to your project, from within the project hover over the "Project Actions" menu and choose the "Share Project" option.  \\

\\
\\
\\

{{:share-dialog.png?400 |}}Enter the emails of the people you'd like to invite in the "Share with" box.  Assign the permissions you'd like them to have for this project. You can allow them to upload, download original files, or share with others.  You can also choose whether the user needs a password to access the content.

Next, you can customize an email that will be sent to the people you are inviting.  Once you click the "Share" button they will be sent the email, containing your personalized message as well as a customized link that will allow them to access your project.

# How to embed video on your website

`<style float-right>`{{:embed-action.png?200|}}`</style>`\\
\\
\\
When on the page with the video you want to embed, hover your mouse over the "Media Actions" menu and choose "Embed".  
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
[{{:embed-dialog.png ]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/embed-video.html)
This will bring up a dialog which contains the embed code for this video.  Changing either one of the dimensions will cause the other dimension to also be changed, maintaining your video's aspect ratio.  
\\
\\
Once you have the video sized appropriately for your webpage and the appropriate options checked, click in the "Embed Code" box and copy all of the HTML code.  This code can then be pasted directly into the HTML document of the webpage where you wish to embed the video.  

Once you have pasted the embed code into the HTML document and saved it, reload the page in your web browser and the video should then display.  

To view the statistics for your embedded video, select the "Embed tracking" option under the "Stats" tab at the top of any page in your Wistia account.

NOTE: Only managers can embed video and only on projects they control.

# How to view tracking statistics for my video

There are two main ways to see viewing statistics for your videos.  If you have embedded the video on your website, you will want to see [embedded video statistics]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/tracking-basic#statistics_for_embedded_videos.html).  If you have shared the video privately, you will want to see [statistics for user sessions]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/tracking-basic#statistics_for_user_sessions.html) where people you invited into Wistia viewed your video content.
