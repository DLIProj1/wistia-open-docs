Just like Ben says in the video, we all make mistakes.  If you've embedded a
video, and now you need to update it in a hurry, the **Replace Video** tool is
a quick and easy way to get it done.  As a bonus, you won't lose stats already
created for the original video.

{{ "This won't replace any copies of the video you've made in your account, only the original." | note }}

## Select the Video to be Replaced

{% post_image hashed_id: '4fdffd1137f199d42da517826c99b7b4142b3e88', class: 'center' %}

Open the video in your account that you want to replacing.

Select the "Replace Video" option under the *Video Actions* menu.


## Choose the Replacement Video

The Replace Video functionality will attempt to cause the least disruption
possible for your embedded video. So while the replacement is uploading and
processing, the old video will continue to play anywhere it is embedded. No
stats or comments will be affected, and the URL for the video in your account
will remain the same (maintaining consistency for any shared links).

To replace the video but keep the same thumbnail, check the *Keep current
thumbnail* option.

Select <span class='faux_button'>Upload Replacement</span> to select the video
file you want to upload.

After selecting a replacement, the progress bar will indicate upload progress. 
After upload, Wistia will encode the replacement video and swap it in,
automatically. No need to update embed codes, URLs, or sharing. All done!
