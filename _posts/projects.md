## Create a new Project

{% post_image hashed_id: '46e709a64e16ee0b7f9f780908480281f3db35a2', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

To create a new project, select *New Project* from under the
<span class="action_menu">Actions</span> menu. A new Project will be created,
and you will immediately be taken in where you can upload content, invite
contacts, and edit the project name.

## Copy an existing Project

{% post_image hashed_id: 'f3c9f1c7deb0e032a0ef0e97665ebbedec99e9dc', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

To copy a Project, select *Copy Project* from under the
<span class="action_menu">Actions</span> menu.

This will launch a dialogue box with a drop-down menu that contains all your
Projects.  Choosing one from the drop-down will create a duplicate of the Project.

## The Project Title

{% post_image hashed_id: '9dcd74438c70331a580f16a2f9c7d6e102899c48', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

The title of the Project is how you will find it in your Account. By default,
the title is *Untitled Project*, but that's not what you want!

Changing the title of the Project won't affect embed codes or links, either.

To edit the title, hover over it with your mouse, and click the
<span class="edit_tag">&nbsp;</span> tag. Edit the title text, and press the
`return` key to finish editing.

## Share a Project Privately

Sharing a Project by Email and Link with other viewers is covered in-depth
on the [private sharing documentation page]({{ '/private-sharing' | post_url }}).

## Playlists

**Playlists** are a video player for multiple videos - all the videos in your 
account. You can select `</> Embed Playlist` to get started, or head over to 
the [playlists doc page]({{ '/playlists' | post_url }}) for more information.

## Project Sections

Project sections allow you to organize media within a project. Media can be put
into project sections and the sections can then expanded or collapsed to provide
a cleaner experience for projects with many media.

A new section will be created, which you can name, and drag-and-drop media into.

<span class="edit_tag"></span>, update the text, and then press `Enter`.
