## Create a new Project

To create a new project, select *New Project* from under the
<span class="action_menu">Actions</span> menu. A new Project will be created,
and you will immediately be taken in where you can upload content, invite
contacts, and edit the project name.

## Copy an existing Project

To copy a Project, select *Copy Project* from under the
<span class="action_menu">Actions</span> menu.

{% post_image hashed_id: '99e00bd8938dbc9276a7facf9bdcaadd8f8cbe6a', class: 'center' %}

This will launch a dialogue box with a drop-down menu that contains all your
Projects. Choosing one from the drop-down will create a duplicate of the Project.

## The Project Title

The title of the Project is how you will find it in your Account. By default,
the title is *Untitled Project*, but that's not what you want!

{% post_image hashed_id: '9dcd74438c70331a580f16a2f9c7d6e102899c48', class: 'center' %}

Changing the title of the Project won't affect embed codes or links, either.

To edit the title, hover over it with your mouse, and click the
<span class="edit_tag">&nbsp;</span> tag. Edit the title text, and press the
`return` key to finish editing.

## Add a description to your Project

{% post_image hashed_id: '61046a0f8885a423432827723d15b0c5ea65e274', class: 'center' %}

The space to add a description to your Project is just under the title. Move
your mouse under the title, and click the *Add a Description* text that
appears.

A new description element will now show up below the title. Start typing to add
your description.

{% post_image hashed_id: '9248c99096631f71e6721cf29a96a5a39a85e6d1', class: 'center' %}

When you are finished, click <span class="faux_button">SAVE</span> and your
changes will be viewable by all.

## Share a Project Privately

Sharing a Project by Email and Link with other viewers is covered in-depth
on the [private sharing documentation page]({{ '/private-sharing' | post_url }}).

## Playlists

**Playlists** are a video player for multiple videos - all the videos in your 
account. You can select `</> Embed Playlist` to get started, or head over to 
the [playlists doc page]({{ '/playlists' | post_url }}) for more information.

## Project Sections

Project sections allow you to organize media within a project. Media can be put
into project sections and the sections can then expanded or collapsed to provide
a cleaner experience for projects with many media. 

{% post_image hashed_id: '7832934fe67fb18882143b3532fb037d44fa529a', class: 'center' %}

To create a section, select `+ New section` from the Project Actions menu.
A new section will be created, which you can name, and drag-and-drop media into.

To give the Section a title, hover over the title text, select the
<span class="edit_tag"></span>, update the text, and then press `Enter`.

## Delete a Project

To delete a project, select *Delete Project* from under the
<span class="action_menu">Project Actions</span> menu.

Say *sayonara* to that project!
