## Choose Your Video

`<style float-right>`{{:mc_1b.png}}`</style>`First, you need to choose which video to include in your Campaign Monitor email.  Head to the page where you can play the video you want.  Make sure the thumbnail for your video is the one you want - it's what will show up in the email.  Head here for instructions on updating the thumbnail: [Updating Your Thumbnail]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/media#how_to_change_the_thumbnail_image_on_a_video.html).

\\
Once you've got it set the way you want, click the "`</>` Embed" button under the video.

## Generating the Campaign Monitor Embed Code

After clicking the "`</>` Embed" button, choose the "For Email Marketing" tab at the top.  Select "Campaign Monitor" as your provider.  Then, update the size of the thumbnail to your liking, and update the URL to point to where your video is embedded.  By default, it will point to the URL of your video in your Wistia account.
\\
\\
\\
Once you are ready, copy the HTML in the "video merge tag" box for use in your Campaign Monitor email.

## Adding Code to Your Campaign Monitor Email

Now it's time to fire up your Campaign Monitor account.  In the email you want to integrate the video link into, paste your "video merge tag" into the HTML and then hit 'preview'.  You should see the video thumbnail and play button appear!
