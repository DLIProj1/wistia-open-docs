description: The upload widget is a simple yet powerful tool for uploading videos outside of your Wistia account. Embed them anywhere you want people to upload content!
post_intro: <p>Upload widgets are perfect for consumer generated content (ie. your viewers upload content they created directly to a Wistia project). Using Wistia Upload Widgets creates an "upload button" on a public page you specify. Upload widgets aren't enabled by default, but give us a shout if you want them activated!</p><p>For more technical information on how Upload Widgets work, read on here:<a href="/doc/upload-widget-specs"> upload widgets tech specs</a>.</p>

To generate an upload widget embed code for a project, follow these steps:

Login to Wistia and navigate to the project for which you would like to create an upload widget

From the <span class="action_menu">Project Actions</span> menu, select *&lt;/&gt; Get Upload Widget*.

If anonymous uploads are not already enabled for the project, you will be presented with a message explaining the situation and a button to enable anonymous uploads.

You will be presented with a form where you can copy the embed code for your upload widget after customizing the dimensions and/or button text.  You may need to press the **tab** key on your keyboard to navigate to the next field to see the updates from your changes.
