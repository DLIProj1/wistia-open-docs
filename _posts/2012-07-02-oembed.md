## oEmbed Support

### Wordpress

If you are looking for help with embedding Wistia videos into Wordpress blog posts, then check out [Wistia and Wordpress]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/wordpress.html).

### oEmbed Link

Wistia allows you to embed your videos in your site using oEmbed ((http://www.oembed.com/)).  Before your videos can be embedded using oEmbed, we need to turn the functionality on for your account.  Please contact us at `<support@wistia.com>` to have this setting enabled.

After oEmbed has been enabled in your account, when you go to embed a video, you will see an option to switch from an HTML snippet to an oEmbed link:

{{ :oembed-radio-button.png?600 |Switch to oEmbed}}

Clicking on this button will change the stuff in the Embed Code text area into an oEmbed link.  You can still change the different settings at the bottom of the dialog, and the parameters of the link will change to reflect whatever you select.

**Note:** Depending on where you are pasting this link, the video may or may not have the same dimensions as what you specify here.  Specifically, it will be resized to fit into the layout wherever it is being pasted.

### Supported Platforms

There are a variety of platforms that support oEmbed, allowing you to embed your Wistia videos in many places across the internet.  Below you will find a partial listing of these platforms, as well as the plugins needed to make them work.  Here is the configuration information that you need:
