## How do I make my company logo appear in my Wistia account?

To upload your logo, you must be logged in as the account owner. Choose the "Account Settings" option under the "Account" tab at the top of any page in your Wistia account.  Then, choose the "Upload your logo" button.  This will cause a dialog box to appear that will guide you through the process of uploading and displaying your company logo in your Wistia account.

## How to change the URL (web address) of my Wistia account?

To change your Wistia account URL, you must be logged in as the account owner.  Choose the "Account Settings" option under the "Account" tab at the top of any page in your Wistia account.  Then, choose the "Settings" button.  A dialog box like the one shown below will appear.

`<style center>`{{:account-settings.png?500|}}`</style>`

In the section labeled "Address" you will see a text box showing the current URL of your Wistia account (in the case of the above picture, http://ben.wistia.com).  Simply type the name you wish to use in the text box (only letters, numbers, and hyphens) and press the "Save settings" button at the bottom. 

Please note that once you change the URL for your account, all previous links referenced by http://YourOldName.wistia.com will no longer work.

## How do I set a custom domain for my Wistia account?

If you have your own domain name, re-naming your Wistia account is no problem.  

First, you should have your CNAME point to: **app.wistia.com**

Once that is set up, the CNAME gets propagated (which can take a couple hours).  Once that is complete, log in to your "Account Settings" in your account. Change the "Address" to CNAME, and enter your new hostname.  

Once you save, everything should be switched over for you, and you are now rocking custom URLs!
