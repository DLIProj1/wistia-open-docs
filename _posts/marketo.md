With the Wistia-Marketo integration you can:


- Generate new leads with [Turnstile]({{ '/turnstile' | post_url }})
- Score leads based on video interaction
- Pipe leads into Smart Lists based on viewing data
- Send emails with integrated video links
- Be a video marketing superstar


Wistia supplies you with lots of video viewing data, but there's so much potential!
With the Wistia-Marketo Integration you can put the rubber to the road, and use
Wistia's stats to better inform your email marketing campaigns. Let's go!


## Get Set Up

To set up _most_ of the Wistia-Marketo integration, you only need to do, well... pretty much nothing at all. If you're on the Wistia Enterprise plan and have a video embedded on your website with [Marketo's Munchkin tracking script enabled](http://developers.marketo.com/documentation/websites/lead-tracking-munchkin-js/), then data is already flowing from Wistia into your Marketo account. Go look! Or, get on [the Enterprise plan](http://wistia.com/pricing) (if you're feeling enterprisey today ðŸš€).

If you also want to use Turnstile with Marketo though (which we'd definitely _not_ recommend if you _don't_ want more leads), just follow these quick steps:

1. In your Wistia account, open the Account menu and click on Settings.
2. Switch to the Email Integrations tab.
3. Choose Marketo, and click the Go To Configuration Step button.
4. Follow those handy on-screen instructions.
5. Call an old friend and catch up. It's been too long, hasn't it?

Congrats, you're all set up! (But if for one reason or another you're _not_ set up, [contact us](http://wistia.com/support/contact) and we'll help you out).

Want to learn how to put your fancy new Wistia-Marketo integration to work? The sections that follow contain the information you seek.


## Collect Leads with Turnstile

With the Wistia-Marketo integration you can gather leads with [Turnstile]({{ '/turnstile' | post_url }}),
and slot them right into your Marketo [Smart Lists](#smart_lists).

After you've set up your Wistia-Marketo integration you can add a Turnstile to
any of your videos. You'll find Turnstile in the
[Timeline Actions]({{ '/customizing-your-video#timeline_actions' | post_url }})
section of the Customize panel.

## Smart Lists

Not only will Wistia be able to track how much of a video was watched, but with
the Marketo Integration you'll be able to add leads to Smart Lists after a
viewer has:

- watched 25% of the video
- 50%
- 75%
- 100%
- clicked a link

Want a list that's just for leads who clicked to download the sales material?
Or want to nudge viewers who only watched 25% of the video? Set up a Smart List
and score leads based on Wistia analytics. You can even send alerts to Lead Owners
when viewers have taken specific actions with your Wistia videos. ðŸŽ‰

## Activity Log

"But Wistia," you say, "what if a viewer filled out another Marketo form?" Fear
not, friend! The Wistia-Marketo Integration will automatically convert previous
visitors into new leads.
