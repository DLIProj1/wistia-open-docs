With the Wistia-Marketo integration you can:

- Score leads based on video interaction and viewing data
- Generate new leads with [Turnstile]({{ '/turnstile' | post_url }})
- Pipe leads into Smart Lists based on viewing data
- Be a video marketing superstar


Wistia supplies you with lots of video viewing data, but there's so much potential!
With the Wistia-Marketo Integration you can put the rubber to the road, and use
Wistia's stats to better inform your email marketing campaigns. Let's go!


## Get Set Up

[How should I know? I don't know]

## Turnstile

With the Wistia-Marketo integration you can gather leads with [Turnstile]({{ '/turnstile' | post_url }}), 
and slot them right into your Marketo [Smart Lists](#smart_lists).

After you've set up your Wistia-Marketo Integration you can add a Turnstile to
any of your videos. You'll find Turnstile in the 
[Timeline Actions]({{ '/customizing-your-video#timeline_actions' | post_url }}) 
section of the Customize panel.

## Smart Lists

Not only will Wistia be able to track how much of a video was watched, but with
the Marketo Integration you'll be able to add leads to Smart Lists after a 
viewer has:

- watched 25% of the video
- 50%
- 75%
- 100%
- clicked a link

Want a list that's just for leads who clicked to download the sales material?
Or want to nudge viewers who only watched 25% of the video? Set up a Smart List
and score leads based on Wistia analytics. You can even send alerts to Lead Owners
when viewers have taken specific actions with your Wistia videos. ðŸŽ‰

## Activity Log

"But Wistia," you say, "what if a viewer filled out another Marketo form?" Fear 
not, friend! The Wistia-Marketo Integration will automatically convert previous 
visitors into new leads.
