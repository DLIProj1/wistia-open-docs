With the Wistia-Marketo integration you can:

- Generate new leads with [Turnstile]({{ '/turnstile' | post_url }})
- Score leads based on video interaction
- Pipe leads into Smart Lists based on viewing data
- Send emails with integrated video links
- Be a video marketing superstar

## Get Set Up

To set up _most_ of the Wistia-Marketo integration, you only need to do, well... pretty much nothing at all. If you're on the Wistia Enterprise plan and have a video embedded on your website with [Marketo's Munchkin tracking script](http://developers.marketo.com/documentation/websites/lead-tracking-munchkin-js/) enabled, then data about how people are watching your videos is already flowing from Wistia into your Marketo account. Go look! Or, get on [the Enterprise plan](http://wistia.com/pricing) if you're feeling enterprisey today. <a href="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/3ipzw811en?popover=true" class="wistia-popover[height=480,playerColor=7b796a,width=640]">ðŸš€</a>

Now, if you want to use Turnstile with Marketo (which we'd definitely _not_ recommend if you _don't_ want more leads), just follow these quick steps:

1. In your Wistia account, open the Account menu and click on Settings.
2. Switch to the Email Integrations tab.
3. Choose Marketo, and click the Go To Configuration Step button.
4. Follow those handy on-screen instructions.
5. Call an old friend and catch up. It's been too long, hasn't it?

Congrats, you're all set up!

Want to learn how to put your fancy new Wistia-Marketo integration to work? The sections that follow contain the information you seek.

## Collect Leads with Turnstile

Remember [that time you configured Turnstile to connect to your Marketo account](#get_set_up)? Well now when people enter their names and email addresses (or just email addresses, if you'd prefer) into Turnstile, they'll automatically get passed from Wistia to Marketo as new leads with the lead source set to "Wistia Video â€“ (name of the video here)". Here's what Turnstile looks like:

{% wistia_embed hashed_id: 06rv6jh26m %}

So that video was just an example, but if that was _your_ video, you'd probably have a brand new lead right about now. That would be cool.

"But Wistia," you ask, "what if that person was already an identified lead in my Marketo account?" Glad you asked. In that case the lead source will remain untouched, like a pristine wilderness.

**Fun fact:** All of the actions a person took on your website _before_ they entered their information into Turnstile will be associated with their lead record, so you can see exactly what the path to conversion was in [the lead's Activity Log in Marketo](https://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Locate+the+Activity+Log+for+a+Lead).

**Yet another fun fact:** That data will live in Wistia too! Anytime you get a new lead through Turnstile, the person's info will appear in right in your Wistia stats along all their viewing activity â€“ even from before they used Turnstile.

To get started with Turnstile, go to a video page in your Wistia account and open the
[Timeline Actions]({{ '/customizing-your-video#timeline_actions' | post_url }})
section of the Customize panel.

## Setting Up Marketing Automation Based on Video Viewing Data

Wouldn't it be cool if when a person watches at least 50% of a certain video on your website, you could automatically set them up to get an email about that product a few days later? Or if a person watched 75% of a video, you could have a salesperson get notified to follow up?

"Why yes, yes that would be quite cool indeed," you say? Phew! Good thing we built this integration. Here's how to do stuff like that:

1. Head to the Marketing Activities section in your Marketo account.
2. Create a new Smart Campaign. Choose a folder, and give the campaign a name. A description too, if you'd like.
3. In the campaign screen, go to the Triggers section in the panel on the right.
4. Find the Visits Web Page trigger, and drag that little guy into the "Drag triggers and filters from the right" area.
  {% post_image hashed_id: 'b13848f78c7bdffb0bb590caf6e8254efbdd927b', class: 'center' %}
5. Now here's where it gets a _little_ weird, but hey, that's what this tutorial is here for. All of events related to how people interact with your videos are recorded as a web page visits in Marketo. So if you wanted the trigger to be when a person watches 75% of a video called "<a href="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/nto1tvx7mz?popover=true" class="wistia-popover[height=360,playerColor=1789ce,width=640]">Making French Toast at Wistia</a>", you'd tell Marketo to set the trigger to be _Web Page --> is --> Wistia Video: "Making French Toast at Wistia" 75% Watched_
  {% post_image hashed_id: 'd64c0b0cfa51632198e2380c43ec6faef28f0371', class: 'center' %}
6. Once you've picked the right event for the right video, move onto the Flow step. That's all Marketo's domain, so [check out the Marketo documentation](https://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Add+a+Flow+Step+to+a+Smart+Campaign) for details.

## Add Video Thumbnail Links to Your Emails
