## What are email alerts? ##

Email alerts are automated emails sent to Wistia managers (and in limited cases other users) which alert them to particular events which have occurred in their Wistia account.  Alerts can be received for the following events:

*  **New media** - Alert manager when media is uploaded or copied into a project
*  **New comment** - Alert manager when new comments are made
*  **Sharing** - Alert manager when someone invites new contacts to view my projects
*  **Download** - Alert manager when someone downloads media
*  **Activation** - Alert manager when a contact activates their account
*  **Login** - Alert manager when a contact logs in to Wistia
*  **Failed login** - Alert manager when someone tries to login to Wistia but enters an incorrect email or password

If a manager is receiving login alerts, when one of their users logs into their Wistia account, they will receive an email that looks like the following:

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/email-alert.png" alt="email-alert" /></div>

## How do I adjust my email alert settings?

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="/images/set-alerts.png" alt="set-alerts" width="400px" /></div>

While logged into your Wistia account, choose the “My Settings” option under the “Account” tab at the top of any page in your Wistia account. You will be taken to a page where you can manage your own personal Wistia settings.  Scroll down the page to the section labeled "Email Alerts".

Here you can set which events you would like to receive alerts for and which events you don't wish to be notified about.
