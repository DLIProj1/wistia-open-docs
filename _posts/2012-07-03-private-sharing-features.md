### Privately share video via email

\\
`<style float-right>`[{{:share-project.png?200]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/private_sharing_features.html)`</style>`
This is the best sharing method to use if you want to:

*  Invite people to privately view your video, and

*  Track how each individual (by email address) watches your video
 
Once you have uploaded your videos to your project, from within the project hover over the "Project Actions" menu and choose the "Share Project" option.
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
`<style float-left>`[{{:share-dialog.png?400]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/private_sharing_features.html)`</style>`Enter the emails of the people you'd like to invite in the "Share with" box.  Assign the permissions you'd like them to have for this project. You can allow them to upload, download original files, or share with others.
\\
\\
You can also choose whether the user needs a password to access the content.  If you choose to require a password (more secure), the user will be prompted to create a password when they click on the link in the email.  In the future, the user will be required to enter their email and password in order to gain access to the content that has been shared with them.  If no password is required, the user will be taken directly to the project upon clicking the link.
\\
\\
Next, you can customize an email that will be sent to the people you are inviting.  Once you click the "Share" button they will be sent the email, containing your personalized message as well as a customized link that will allow them to access your project.

### Privately share video by link

`<style float-right>`[{{:share-project.png?200]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/private_sharing_features.html)`</style>`
This is the best sharing method to use if you want to:

*  Send out a single link from your own email account to a group people to allow them to view your video

*  Track how people watch your video, but are less concerned about associating viewing with a viewer's email address
 
Once you have uploaded your videos to your project, from within the project hover over the "Project Actions" menu and choose the "Share Project" option.  
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
`<style float-left>`[{{:share_by_link.png?400]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/private_sharing_features.html)`</style>`When the dialog appears choose the tab which says "Share by Link".  The screen to the left will be seen.  To create a link which can be pasted into an email, click the "Enable sharing by link for this project" button.
\\
\\
\\
\\
`<style float-right>`[{{:share-by-link-2.png?400]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/private_sharing_features.html)`</style>`
Once the button has been clicked, the link will appear.  You can simply copy this link and paste it into an email or put it on a webpage.  When users click on this link, they will automatically be taken into this Wistia project.
\\
\\
If the "Disable sharing by link for this project" is clicked the previous project link will no longer be active.  Users that click on a disabled link will be denied access to your content.

## How Wistia Appears For Your Viewers

When you invite new viewers into your account to privately view video, they will only have access to parts of the account that have been shared with them or they have been giving access to.  Let's walk through an example of how this will look from your viewer's perspective.
\\
\\
### The Share Dialog Box

We'll start with a quick review of the Share dialog box.

`<style float-right>`[{{:ben-share.png}}]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/private_sharing_features.html)`</style>` Enter the emails of the people you'd like to invite in the “Share with” box. Assign the permissions you'd like them to have for this project. You can allow them to upload, download original files, or share with others.

You can also choose whether the user needs a password to access the content. If you choose to require a password (more secure), the user will be prompted to create a password when they click on the link in the email. In the future, the user will be required to enter their email and password in order to gain access to the content that has been shared with them. If no password is required, the user will be taken directly to the project upon clicking the link.

You can also customize the wording of the email message that will be sent to the people you are inviting. 
\\

\\
\\
\\

### The Invitation Email

`<style float-right>`[{{:shared-email.png}}]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/private_sharing_features.html)`</style>` After clicking the "Share" button, your viewer will receive an email at the address you have designated.  This email will include an invitation to view the project you are sharing, along with a link for their access.  This activation link is specifically designed for their email, and is only good for one use (the email cannot be forwarded).
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\

### The Credential Creation Screen

`<style float-right>`[{{:credentials.png}}]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/private_sharing_features.html)`</style>` After clicking the activation link, viewers who have never interacted with the Wistia system will land on a page where they can create Wistia credentials.  If you have required them to use a password to access the content, they will need to create a password for their access as well.
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\

### The Viewer's Perspective

`<style float-right>`[{{:user-view.png}}]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/private_sharing_features.html)`</style>` When your viewer logs in, they will enter the Project you have shared with them, but they will see it in a functionally stripped down way.  The tabs will not contain any information specific to the account, nor will it allow the viewer access to the other Projects in the account, etc.
\\
\\
To hide the sharing list from viewers, simply hover over the "Sharing" sidebar element on the right-hand side of the Project, and click the trash can icon that appears next to the word 'Sharing'.  To bring the sidebar element back at any time, choose "Add Sidebar Element" under the"Project Actions" drop-down and then add a "Sharing List" sidebar element.
