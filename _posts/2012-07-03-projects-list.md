** The Projects List page is the homepage of your account.  From here, you can navigate to your Projects and create new ones.**

\\

## 1. The Projects List

The #1 element above corresponds to the Projects list in your Account.  The Projects list contains all of your Projects, sorted by "last updated".  In this way, the Projects you are currently working on will stay at the top.  But we need to take one step back and define a Project!
\\

### What the heck is a Project?

A project is Wistia's method for grouping related media. You might create a project with all the training videos for your organization, or all the sales materials related to a specific product. You can think of Projects like the folders on your local computer: they are for storing your stuff in a logical manner.  There are lots of uses and functions within projects, which we will cover below.

\\
Much more on Projects and what you can do with them on the [Project Actions page]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/projects.html).

## 2. The Search Box

Because the Projects list page is the main page of your account, it is where you will start most of your Wistia sessions.  The search box (pretty unique title, eh?) can be used to search for Projects, Contacts, Media, and even descriptions (ie. titles and descriptive sidebar elements).
\\
\\
The search box is present on any page in your Wistia account.

## 3. The Actions Drop-Down Menu

`<style float-right>`{{:actions_drop_down.png}}`</style>`The Projects List page has an "Actions" drop-down menu that provides 3 options:
 1.  **New Project:** for creating a New Project to put a group of media into
 2.  **Copy Project:** to create a copy of an existing Project.
 3.  **Add Sidebar Element:** Descriptive Sidebar elements are useful for providing additional information or context about the Project.  On the Project Listings page, the Sidebar Element could be used to direct your users to a support contact, or to explain what certain Projects contain.

## More Projects List page functionality

### How to create a Project?

`<style float-right>`[{{:new-project.png]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/projects.html)`</style>`To create a project, login as a manager, hover over the "Actions" menu on the "My Projects" page, and select "New Project".  Once you click "New Project", you will immediately be taken into the new project where you can upload content, invite contacts, and edit the project name.

### How to copy a Project?

`<style float-right>`[{{:new-project.png]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/projects.html)`</style>`
\\
\\
\\
To copy a Project, select "Copy Project" from under the "Actions" drop-down menu.
\\
\\
\\
\\
`<style float-right>`[{{:copy2.png]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/projects.html)`</style>`
\\
\\
This will launch a screen with a drop-down menu that contains all your Projects.  Choosing one from the drop-down will create a duplicate of the Project.
