#  Embedding Video in Google Sites 

Google Sites does not allow the standard HTML embed codes, but it does allow embedding via iframe.
Here's a step by step guide how to do this:


First, go to the **Insert** menu and select **More gadgets**

Then search for "iframe" and select the "Iframe Wrapper" gadget.

Now, you're going to need to jump into your Wistia account and copy the oEmbed embed code for the video you want to embed. If you don't already have oEmbed enabled for your account email us at `<support@wistia.com>` and we'll turn it on for you in no time flat!

Go back to Google Sites and paste your oEmbed code into the "Document/Page URL" field. You'll also want to set the appropriate Width and Height so it matches the size of your video.

Click OK and you should see a placeholder box where your video will display. Save the page and you should see your video there:

You're done!
