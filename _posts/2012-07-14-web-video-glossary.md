## What is transcoding?

Transcoding is the process of converting a file from one format to a different format.  Most files types (video especially) are not natively viewable in a web browser.  When a user uploads to Wistia, the system transcodes the file from its original format to a format which is able to be viewed by everyone on the web.

## What is a video heatmap?

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/heatmap_sketch.png" alt="" /></div>

A video heatmap is a graphical representation of a single viewing session of your video.  Heatmaps contain viewer information, contextual information (when the video was watched and where) and a color-coded timeline which represents how the viewer interacted with the video.

*  White means that portion of the video was not watched.
*  green tells you that the viewer watched that part exactly once.  
*  Yellow, orange, light red, and dark red show you that the viewer watched that part of the video two, three, four, or five times respectively.  

Next to each heatmap is shown the total percentage of the video that viewer watched (parts watched multiple times are only counted once).
