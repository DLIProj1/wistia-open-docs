Before you can start developing applications that use the API, you need to enable your account for API access.
\\
\\
`<style float-right>`{{:api_account_dashboard.png}}`</style>`
\\
\\
Open up the Account Dashboard for your account (note, only the Account owner will be able to do this, so make sure you have those credentials).
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
`<style float-right>`{{:api_enable_button.png}}`</style>`
On the Account Dashboard, find the button labeled "API".  This will bring up a dialogue box that requests permission to enable API access for the account.  If you've made it this far, you probably want to, so click 'enable'.  This step makes it so you can disable access later.
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
`<style float-right>`{{:api_api_key.png}}`</style>`
Once you have clicked on the "Enable API Access" button, the dialog will refresh and you'll be able to get your API password.  The user name for API access is always "api".
\\
\\

**Note:** If you disable API access to your account and then choose to re-enable it later, your API password will change!
\\
\\
Once you have API access enabled, head over to the [Data API docs]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/http://wistia.com/doc/wistia_api.html.html) to see the functionality provided by the API.
