# Wistia and Wordpress

{{ :wistia_wordpress.png }}

When the right settings are enabled, Wistia and Wordpress go together like...chocolate and marshmallow (insert your favorite food pairing).

You can integrate Wistia with Wordpress in two quick and easy steps:
 1.  Email `<support@wistia.com>`, and let us know that you would like to use Wordpress. We will enable oEmbeds for your account. oEmbed codes are what Wordpress uses when embedding video files.
 2.  Download and install the [Wistia Wordpress Plug-in]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wistia-wordpress-oembed-plugin/.html).  The plug-in makes Wistia oEmbeds show up on your Wordpress account!

Notes on using Wordpress:

*  When inserting the oEmbed link, make sure you enter into HTML mode, and leave a line open above and below the code.

*  If you have larger resolution videos, and they are appearing smaller or squished, access the Wordpress admin control panel (Settings -> Media -> Maximum Video Embed Size) and set the max to the largest size of your video ('no limit' setting doesn't work, must be actual size).
