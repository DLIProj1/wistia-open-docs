## What are email alerts? ##

Email alerts are automated emails sent to Wistia Managers (and, in limited cases, other users) that alert them to particular events that have occurred in their Wistia account.  Alerts can be received for the following events:

*  **New media** - Alert Manager when media is uploaded or copied into a project
*  **New comment** - Alert Manager when new comments are made
*  **Sharing** - Alert Manager when someone invites new contacts to view my projects
*  **Download** - Alert Manager when someone downloads media
*  **Activation** - Alert Manager when a contact activates their account
*  **Login** - Alert Manager when a contact logs in to Wistia
*  **Failed login** - Alert Manager when someone tries to login to Wistia but enters an incorrect email or password

If a Manager is receiving login alerts, when one of their users logs into their Wistia account, they will receive an email that looks like the following:

## How do I adjust my email alert settings?

While logged into your Wistia account, choose the **Settings** option under the **Account** tab at the top of any page in your Wistia account. You will be taken to a page where you can manage your own personal Wistia settings.  Scroll down the page to the section labeled "Email Notifications."

Need to know when someone uploads new content or adds users to a project? Bogged down with too many emails? Adjust your settings here!
