Wistia [analytics](/analytics.html) make it easy to see viewing data, from the high-level account view, down to the single media.  To drill down to a single media stats view, follow these directions.


First, open up the Media Page for your video (where you can watch the video in your account).  Under the *Media Actions* drop-down menu, select "Stats".

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/ms_zero_to_hero.png" alt="ms_zero_to_hero" /></div>

This will open the page with viewing stats specifically for that media.  You can see the [overall engagement graph](/audience_engagement_graph.html), summary stats, and [individual viewer heatmaps](/heatmaps.html).

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/ms_media_page.png" alt="ms_media_page" /></div>

Embedding your video on your public webpage?  Wistia Media Stats will tell you how it is performing (and [Wistia trends](/analytics.html) will show you how it is performing compared to your other video initiatives).
