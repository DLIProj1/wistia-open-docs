## Embed Your Video

The first step is embedding your video on your webpage (or blog, e-commerce site, etc.)  For more info on this, please check out our documentation on [embedding]({{ '/embedding' | post_url }}).  For Clicky and your video to be able to interact, **you must choose the API embed code** from the Embed Type section of the Super Embed Builder.

## Add Clicky Tracking

The next step is creating an account with Clicky and adding your website to your account tracking.  To create Clicky account, [head over to the Clicky website](http://getclicky.com).

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/1b7e9a7b2a7f0c01374a4b8e3c4bfafdfd6564b8.png" alt="clicky-user" /></div>

Once you have your account set up, adding a website to track is easy to do.  Starting on your Clicky user profile (which you can find at https://secure.getclicky.com/user), click the "Add New Site" button.

Enter the site URL into the box, as shown here.

On the submission page, check to be sure your information is correct, and enter any custom settings into the "Advanced Settings" page.  Then, click the link to the tracking code page.

On the tracking code page, select and copy the code, and paste it into the HTML on your webpage.  You're all set and ready to start tracking real-time stats using Clicky!



## Start Tracking Video Views

It's time to start tracking video views in your Clicky dashboard.  We've created a simple Javascript function to help you do this. This code should follow each Wistia embed on your page, updated with the ID #, URL, and title of the video.
	
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
<script type="text/javascript">
wistiaEmbed.bind("play", function() {
  clicky.video('play',0, 'http://www.mysite.com/mypage/#video', 'Test Video');
});
</script>
</code></pre>

**Bonus:** to track the finish viewing stats as well, use <span class="code">wistiaEmbed.bind("end", yourFunction)</span>.

## Check Your Stats!

To find your video view stats in your Clicky account, select the "Content" tab from the left-hand bar, and then select "video".  Your video stats should now appear!
