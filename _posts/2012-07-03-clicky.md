## Step 1. Embed Your Video into a Public Webpage

The first step is using the embed codes for your video to display it on your webpage (or blog, e-commerce site, etc.)  For more info on this, please check out our documentation on [embedding your videos](/sharing#embed_a_video_on_your_website).

**Note:** for Clicky and your video to be able to interact, you'll need to choose the API embed code from the Embed Type section of the Super Embed Builder.

## Step 2. Add Clicky Tracking to Your Page

The next step is creating an account with Clicky and adding your website to your account tracking.  To create Clicky account, [head over to the Clicky website](http://getclicky.com).

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="/images/clicky-user.png" alt="clicky-user" /></div>

Once you have your account set up, adding a website to track is easy to do.  Starting on your Clicky user profile (which you can find at https://secure.getclicky.com/user), click the "Add New Site" button.



<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="/images/clicky-new-site.png" alt="clicky-new-site" /></div>

Enter the site URL into the box, as shown here.

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/clicky-submit.png" alt="clicky-submit" /></div>

On the submission page, check to be sure your information is correct, and enter any custom settings into the "Advanced Settings" page.  Then, click the link to the tracking code page.

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/clicky-trackingcode.png" alt="clicky-trackingcode" /></div>

On the tracking code page, select and copy the code, and paste it into the HTML on your webpage.  You're all set and ready to start tracking real-time stats using Clicky!



## Step 3. Start Tracking Video Views With Clicky

It's time to start tracking video views in your Clicky dashboard.  We've created a simple Javascript function to help you do this. This code should follow each Wistia embed on your page, updated with the ID #, URL, and title of the video.
	
<div class='github'>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/3087702.js?file=Clicky Embed.js"></script>
</div>

**Bonus:** to track the finish viewing stats as well, use <span class="code">wistiaEmbed.bind("end", yourFunction)</span>.

## Step 4. Check Your Stats

To find your video view stats in your Clicky account, select the "Content" tab from the left-hand bar, and then select "video".  Your video stats should now appear!
