[MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com) is our favorite email marketing system.  When we need to send an email to our wonderful customers, and don't want it to get stuck in spam filters, we use MailChimp.

They also provide some pretty neat tools for discovering how your email marketing funnel works.  For our Wistia users, we wanted to create a seamless experience where they could send tailored email campaigns that included Wistia videos, and then track how their contacts interacted with the video itself.

So let's dive in to how to create an email campaign with Wistia &amp; MailChimp!

## Prework

The first step is choosing the video you'd like to show off in your campaign.

Start by embedding the video on the landing page you'll be using (or, if you're having it point to your Wistia Media Page, you're all set).  Follow the embedding steps if you have any trouble: [Embedding Your Video](/public_sharing.html).

## Create Your Merge Tag

Next, select <span class="code">Email Marketing</span> from under the Media Actions menu.

In the Email Marketing window, choose "MailChimp" from the Email provider drop-down (it should be first, because we &lt;3 them).  Then tweak your settings for thumbnail size (how big it will appear in the email) and landing page (once they click on the thumbnail, where should they go? - hint: where the video is!).

**Tip:** Our thumbnail default size of 450px is the same as MailChimp and looks great in most email software.  If you'd like to test a different size, use "pop-up preview" in MailChimp after pasting in a revised Merge Tag.

**Note:** if you haven't set this as a "public" project, you will be prompted to do that before embedding.  You need to be able to share the media by link in order to use email marketing.

## Paste Your Merge Tag Into MailChimp

After getting the thumbnail and link settings working the way you'd like, copy the "Video Merge Tag" code, and paste it into the body of your MailChimp email.

**Tip:** I normally send myself a test, to make sure everything is working correctly.

## Start Tracking Viewing!

Once your viewers receive their emails, they will start clicking your video!

The great part about MailChimp and Wistia together is that the merge tag has your recipient's email address built in - so when tracking the stats you can see exactly which emails watched the video, and up to the second how much they watched.  Now how cool is that? Make sure you check in the "Public and Embed Stats" for the viewing stats.

**Tip:** If you would like to keep the email campaign separate from the other embedded viewings of the video, set up a separate project specifically for the email version of the video.
