Here at Wistia, we kept hearing whispers of a networking site called "the facebook". Everyone said it was really the bees knees. They even made a movie about it - so it must be good.

We put on our thinking caps and did a bit of tweaking and ta-da! Now you can embed Wistia videos as a status update on Facebook just like Vimeo and YouTube videos. The added bonus of using Wistia is that you can get video heatmap analytics on your Facebook embeds!

**To embed your video into Facebook, follow these steps:**
 1.  Go to the page with the video you'd like to share on Facebook. Under the Media Actions menu, select "share by link".
 2.  Copy the share link, paste it into your Facebook status box and click "share".
 3.  Your friends will be able to see the video in their News Feed, and even play it within the Feed - how neat is that!?

The embed action will automatically pull it in to the status feed!  You can see an example of this in Ben's description of "The Social Network" at right.
