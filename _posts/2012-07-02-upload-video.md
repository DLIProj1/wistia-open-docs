# How to upload a video to Wistia


Videos must be uploaded inside a project.  

Either create a new project by selecting "New Project" from the Projects drop down menu on any page or click into an existing project where you would like to upload the video.

\\

Next, hover over the "Project Actions" menu and select "Upload Media".  

A dialog will then be shown which allows you to choose the file to upload from your local computer.  To upload multiple media at once, hold down the shift or ctrl buttons while browsing.
\\
\\
\\
\\
Once a file has been chosen, you will see the progress of the file uploading as in the image below.
