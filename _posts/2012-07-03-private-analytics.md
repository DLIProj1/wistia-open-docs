If you have invited viewers in to view videos in your account through the [Private Sharing]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/private_sharing.html) workflow, their analytics will show up in the Private Sessions area of your account.  To view these viewing sessions, follow the directions below:
\\
\\
`<style float-right>`{{:pa_private_user_sessions_dropdown.png|}}`</style>`
\\
\\
\\
\\
To view the individual user statistics for people you invited into Wistia, select the "User sessions" option under the "Stats" tab at the top of any page in your Wistia account.  
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
`<style float-right>`{{:pa_private_user_sessions.png|}}`</style>`
\\
\\
\\

You will see a list of all user sessions for the users that have logged into your Wistia account.  To see exactly what each user did in each session, click on the "Stats" magnifying glass next to the session. 
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
`<style float-right>`{{:pa_private_user.png|}}`</style>`
\\
\\
A complete audit trail will be shown with all of the actions the user took while they were logged in to your Wistia account.  This includes amount of time spent on various pages as well as video heatmaps for the videos that they viewed.
