Audience Engagement Graphs show how the audience as a whole has viewed your video, whereas [heatmaps]({{ '/embedded-video-analytics#heatmaps' | post_url }}) show how an individual watched your video. 

By looking at the Audience Engagement Graph, you can see where your audience rewinds and watches multiple times and when they stop watching.  The blue section of the engagement graph shows the engagement of viewers who clicked play on the video. The orange section on top shows the number of times that section was re-watched. Move your cursor over the graph (from left to right) to see specific information and frame in the video, and click the graph to play the video from that point. Click any of the waypoints below the graph to see specific data pertaining to these Actions.

All of this information can help you both optimize this video as well as guide you in making videos to better engage your audience in the future.

Next to the engagement graph are summary stats to give you a high-level view of how that video has performed to-date. Click **Show Details** to see a deeper look into those numbers.

The summary stats contains useful metrics like the percentage of visitors that clicked play, and valuable statistics around viewer Actions (how many people clicked on your spiffy [Call to Action]({{ '/customizing-your-video#timeline_actions' | post_url }})). Within the **Details** section we show you how we get these numbers. 

For example, the **Play Rate** metric is the number of people that played your video divided by the unique visitors that came to the page containing the video (expressed as a percentage).  This metric helps you understand things such as the positioning of your video on the page or the thumbnail image used for the video affects whether users make the commitment to watch your video.

We get the **Actions** metric by dividing how many people interacted with your Actions (clicked on them, or entered their email with Turnstile) by how many people viewed them in total.

The summary stats are also available in explanation form, which makes it easy to express those high-level stats to others, like a client or a boss.
