Audience Engagement Graphs show how the audience as a whole has viewed your video, whereas heatmaps show how an individual watched your video. 

By looking at the Audience Engagement Graph, you can see where your audience rewinds and watches multiple times and when they stop watching.  The blue section of the engagement graph shows the engagement of viewers who clicked play on the video. The orange section on top shows the number of times that section was re-watched. Move your cursor over the graph (from left to right) to see specific information for a time in the video, and click the graph to jump to that point in the video. This information can help you both optimize this video as well as guide you in making videos to better engage your audience in the future.

Underneath the engagement graph are summary stats to give you a high-level view of how that video has performed to-date.
The summary stats contains useful metrics like "percentage of visitors that clicked play".  This metric is the number of people that played your video divided by the unique visitors that came to the page containing the video (expressed as a percentage).  This metric helps you understand things such as the positioning of your video on the page or the thumbnail image used for the video affects whether users make the commitment to watch your video.

The summary stats are also available in explanation form, which makes it easy to express those high-level stats to others, like a client or a boss.
