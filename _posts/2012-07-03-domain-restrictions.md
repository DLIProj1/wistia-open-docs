Video embed domain restrictions allows you to prevent a malicious viewer from stealing your embed code off your page.  When domain restriction is set up, the videos in your account will only display on the domains you specify.

**A Note:** Domain Restrictions will not work with SSL embeds.

To get started with video embed domain restrictions:

1. Head to to your Wistia Account Dashboard and click on the new button titled "Embed Settings".
