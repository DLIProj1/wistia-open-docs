## How it works

This integration let's you easily embed a thumbnail of your video in your email
campaign. When visitors click the video image with the play button, they'll be
sent to your website to watch the video.

When you use this integration, your recipients email addresses are automatically
piped through to your Wistia stats. So for everyone who clicks through on the
email, you'll be able to see who they are and what parts of the video they've watched!

## 1. Get the email marketing embed code from Wistia

{% post_image hashed_id: 'c73f6e28514a8ce52e59636069fc7418e6d61c6c', width: 1067, height: 807 %}

Navigate to a video in your account and click *Embed & Share* from the *Video Actions* menu, then select *Link in Email Campaign*.
Change the size, play button color, and page the video links to. Then copy the embed code.
I've highlighted the embed code in that pretty pink box.


## 2. Head over to HubSpot's Email Builder

{% post_image hashed_id: '441a85383456dac91881885259a11a892cdf3448', width: 1386, height: 874 %}

When you're editing your email in HubSpot, click the *HTML* button in the *Main Body Text* editor.
This will ensure that the editor won't mess with the code that we paste in.


## 3. Paste in the code

{% post_image hashed_id: '3d7952a3bc67d57598f7fc46102173093ad9ece5', width: 1386, height: 874 %}

Now just paste in the code from Wistia. You should see the thumbnail of your video appear in the 
preview window. Pretty cool, eh?

At this point, it's safe to switch back to the Visual editing mode if you like.


## 4. Send that email

You're all set to send the email. It's always good to send a test message to yourself
first to make sure everything's linked up right. Note that when HubSpot sends the test message
it will pass through "EMAIL" to our tracking system instead of your actual email address.

When you send the actual email, it will substitute the recipients emails in instead.

May your click-through rates be high and your video engagements long!
