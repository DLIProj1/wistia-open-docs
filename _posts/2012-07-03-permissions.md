With Wistia, each contact in your account has a set of permissions.  These permissions set out the rules for how they can interact with the files in your account.  In general, the permissions users can have are:
\\

*  Create Projects

*  Upload & Download Media

*  Share Media/Projects

*  Track Stats and Account Usage Levels

*  Create New Contacts

*  Embed Videos

Wistia has three main levels of permissions: Account Owner level permissions, Manager permissions, and Contact permissions.  The access each level has is defined below:

## Owner-Level Permissions

The Owner of the Wistia Account has the highest permissions of any user.  There is only one Owner-level Contact on each Account, which can be set from the "Settings" screen of the Account Dashboard.

`<style s25>`Owners have access to anything a manager or contact does, but in addition, they can:

*  Check the Stats of Any Project

*  Monitor the Usage of the Account (bandwidth & storage)

*  Add new Managers to the Account

*  Change the Logo, Name, or URL on the Account

*  Cancel the Wistia Account
`</style>`

## Manager-Level Permissions

"Managers" in Wistia are the controllers of the content in accounts.  Each Wistia account, no matter the level, comes default with 2 Manager spots (one is defaulted to the Owner of the Account).  Managers can do things like add Projects, upload medias, and share those Projects/videos with new viewers.  They can also control contacts, create new groups, and send messages out to those contacts.

`<style s25>`Managers can:

*  Create and manage projects

*  Create new viewers and manage their permissions

*  Upload video and other media content

*  Invite viewers to privately view video

*  View tracking statistics for private video sharing

*  Publish videos to third party websites (also called "embedding a video")

*  View embedded video statistics

*  Receive email alerts for account activity
`</style>`
\\

## Contact-Level Permissions

"Contacts" must be created by the Account owners or Managers.  The access that contacts have can be limited to viewing a specific Project, and the videos contained therein.  When a contact is created, their access can also include things like the ability to upload new content, download content, and share content.  Contacts by default are required to create a password to access the system, however this can be turned off as well.
