The Media Page is where you can interact with the individual media in your Account. 
Share it, check the stats, and embed it.

## 1. The Media Title

The title of the Media is how you will find it in your Account.  The title defaults to the name of the media you uploaded to your Account, but can be updated anytime.  To edit the title, click on the title with your mouse and edit the text.  Then press the 'return' button to finish editing.

---

## 2. The Video & Quick-Action buttons

The media itself lives on the Media Page, so you can play it back and allow others to view it.  Underneath the video are quick links to several frequently-used actions: Embed, Download, and Expand.

*  **Embed** will bring up the [Embed Builder](/embed_screen.html), where you can design how your video should appear on an external page.
*  **Download** brings up a screen including the several transcoded versions of the video.  From here you can download the original or web-ready versions to your computer.
*  **Expand** makes the Wistia player larger on the Media Page.

## 3. The Media Actions drop-down menu

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/media_actions_dd.png" alt="media_actions_dd" /></div>

The Media Actions drop-down menu gives admins access to all kinds of additional functionality on the Media Page:

  1. **Embed:** This option brings up the [SuperEmbed builder](/embed_screen.html), where you can customize how your video will appear and behave on your external site.
  2. **Email Marketing:** For generating an embed for use in email campaign software like MailChimp, Constant Contact, and Campaign Monitor.
  3. **Share by Link:** Share by Link allows you to turn the media public, meaning it can be accessed by anyone with the link.  Enable/disable public access to the video here.  You'll also use this link for sharing on Facebook and Twitter.
  4. **Download:** This option allows you to download the video and transcoded formats.
  5. **Change Thumbnail:** For updating the thumbnail image that displays before your video.  This feature is detailed further [below](#How_to_change_the_thumbnail_image_on_a_video.html).
  6. **Add Sidebar Element:** Sidebar elements are useful for adding descriptions and context to your Media Page. Use a Sidebar Element to provide links for further information, or for telling the viewer what to view next in your Wistia Account.
  7. **Create Transcript:** Use this option to order a transcript created for your video.  Wistia's interactive transcripts are available at a cost of $5 per minute of video transcribed and are ready within 24 hours.
  8. **Add to SEO Sitemap:** If you have created a video sitemap for use with your Wistia account, you can add a video to that sitemap using this option.
  9. **Stats:** This link will take you directly to the Public & Embedded stats for this video.
  10. **Delete:** Don't push the red button!  No really, only press this if you want to delete the video.

## How to enable or prevent users from downloading media

By default, contacts invited into Wistia are not permitted to download your media files.  A contact's ability to download files is controlled via permissions at the project level.  To adjust a contact's permissions for a particular project, go into that project and choose "Manage permissions" from the Project Actions menu.

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="/images/manage-permissions.png" alt="manage-permissions" width="180px" /></div>

After clicking the <span class="code">Manage permissions</span> option, the following dialog will be shown with a matrix of permissions for your contacts.  To enable a particular contact to download your media files, check the "Download" box for that contact.  To revoke download permissions for a contact, uncheck the "Download" box.  After setting the permissions appropriately, hit the "Update Permissions" button at the bottom of the dialog.

Please note that the above action changes the permissions for a contact on a particular project.  If the contact is shared on other projects, their permissions on those other projects will not be affected.

## How to change the thumbnail image on a video

<div class="video_embed"><iframe src="http://fast.wistia.com/embed/iframe/05f95d19ea?controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&playerColor=aae3d8&version=v1&videoHeight=400&videoWidth=640" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" width="640" height="400"></iframe></div>

The thumbnail image for a video can be set in one of two ways:

* A frame can be chosen from the video
* An image can be uploaded to be used as the thumbnail image

Both methods of changing the thumbnail image can be accessed from the same point in the application.  First, go to the page where the video is displayed.   Then, from the Media Actions menu, choose "Change Thumbnail".

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="/images/change-thumbnail.png" alt="change-thumbnail" width="400px" /></div>

  1. Choosing a frame: You can select a frame from the video to be the thumbnail for the video.  To do this, seek to the point in the video where the frame you want to use is displayed in the video player.  Then, click the "Set current frame as thumbnail" button.
  2. Upload thumbnail: You always have the option to upload a new image as the thumbnail image for a video.  Simply click the "Choose file" button and find the file on your local computer.  When done, hit the "Upload thumbnail" button and the old video thumbnail will be replaced with your new one.

<!-- to be combined into 'comments' -->

## What are timecoded comments?

Timecoded comments allow the user to link a comment on a video to a particular time in the video.  The timecode is captured and stored with the comment such that when another user views the comment, they can click on the time code, the video will skip directly to the point in the video where the comment was made.

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/timecoded-comment.png" width="450px" alt="timecoded-comment" /></div>

### How to make a timecoded comment

To make a timecoded comment, pause the video at the time to which you wish the comment to be linked.  Then, simply check the box next to the Post Comment button which says "Link comment to current time in video".  Once the box is checked and the comment has been written, click the Post comment button and your comment will be saved.

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="/images/make-comment.png" alt="make-comment" width="450px" /></div>

### Can I turn off comments for videos and other media?

Yes. Comments can be disabled/enabled at the project level.  See ["How to disable comments for a project"](/projects#How to disable comments for a project.html) to learn how.

## How to add a description to your video

To add a description to your video, first go to the page where the video can be viewed.  Now, choose "Add Sidebar Element" from the Media Actions menu.  This will bring up a dialog box.  Press the "Add" button for the Description sidebar element.

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/add-sidebar.png" alt="add-sidebar" width="400px" /></div>

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="/images/description.png" alt="description" width="180px" /></div>

A new description element will now show up below the Media Actions menu.  Clicking the "Edit" button below the Description element will bring up the rich-text editor.  Within the rich-text editor, you can edit the description visually or directly edit the source HTML for the description. When finished editing, click the "Save" button below the Description element and your changes will be saved.
