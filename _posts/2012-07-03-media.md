## Upload Video

Before you can do anything awesome with your videos, you have to upload them! 

This is such an important step, we dedicated a whole support page to it: [Uploading Video](/upload-video.html)

## Update Video Title

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/6237ca4305b7280113ff157b42bbe9455f28e317.png" alt="title_edit" /></div>

The title of the Media is how you will find it in your Account.  By default, the title is the name of the media you uploaded, but can be updated anytime (doesn't have to be set before uploading). Changing the title of the video won't affect embed codes or links, either.

To edit the title, hover over it with your mouse, and click the <span class="edit_tag"></span> tag. Edit the title text, and press the <span class="code">return</span> key to finish editing.

## Change the Thumbnail

<div class="video_embed"><iframe src="http://fast.wistia.com/embed/iframe/05f95d19ea?playerColor=688AAD&version=v1&videoHeight=413&videoWidth=660" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" width="660" height="413"></iframe></div>

When you upload your video, Wistia will automatically select the frame closest to the center as the thumbnail. Sometimes, this can produce some pretty funny results. Want to change the thumbnail to a different frame, or upload one of your own?

No problem - the Change Thumbnail tool is here to help.  

  * *Set to a new frame in the video*: select the frame you would like, and then select *Update Thumbnail* from the <span class="action_menu">Media Actions</span> menu.
  * *Upload an image as the thumbnail*: select the *Update Thumbnail* from the <span class="action_menu">Media Actions</span> menu, and choose your image, then select Upload Thumbnail.

## Embed Video

The ins-and-outs of embedding your video is the subject of another page in the documentation. To see more, head to the [embedding documentation](/embedding.html).

## Downloading Media 

By default, contacts invited into Wistia are not permitted to download your media files.  A contact's ability to download files is controlled via permissions at the project level.  To adjust a contact's permissions for a particular project, go into that project and choose *Manage Viewers* from the <span class="action_menu">Project Actions</span> menu.

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/ef8671f1509055c3d946b29c5f894d0cd36011b4.png" alt="manage-permissions" width="180px" /></div>

After clicking the *Manage Viewers* option, the following dialog will be shown with a matrix of permissions for your contacts.  To enable a particular contact to download your media files, check the "Download" box for that contact.  To revoke download permissions for a contact, uncheck the "Download" box.  After setting the permissions appropriately, hit <span class="faux_button">Update Permissions</span> at the bottom of the dialog.

<div class="clear"></div>

**Note**: Updating the permissions for a contact on a particular project only affects that Project.  If the contact is shared on other projects, their permissions on those other projects will not be affected.

## Comments

### What are timecoded comments?

Timecoded comments allow the user to link a comment on a video to a particular time in the video.  The timecode is captured and stored with the comment such that when another user views the comment, they can click on the time code, the video will skip directly to the point in the video where the comment was made.

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/timecoded-comment.png" width="450px" alt="timecoded-comment" /></div>

### How to make a timecoded comment

To make a timecoded comment, pause the video at the time to which you wish the comment to be linked.  Then, simply check the box next to the Post Comment button which says "Link comment to current time in video".  Once the box is checked and the comment has been written, click the <span class="faux_button">Post comment</span> and your comment will be saved.

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/make-comment.png" alt="make-comment" width="450px" /></div>

### Can I turn off comments for videos and other media?

Yes. Comments can be disabled/enabled at the project level.  See ["How to disable comments for a project"](/projects#How to disable comments for a project.html) to learn how.

## Video Description

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/8d15638f5950a8c0773ebbbe974b9dcc7c0525c2.png" alt="description" /></div>

To add a description to your video, select *Add Description* from under the <span class="action_menu">Media Actions</span> menu.

Descriptions are most helpful for sharing links to view video in your Wistia account (where viewers need additional context). Your video description will also be passed through to services like Facebook ([see more on social sharing](/social-sharing.html)).

## Copy Video

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/13c548876a74d57756358e445cc1c81fda810144.png" alt="copy_media_menu" /></div>

<div class="post_image float_right"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/291a422b9c226d33d9c44a30539e42f4e4627b04.png" alt="copy_media_popup" /></div>

First, navigate to the project you want the copied video **to end up in**.  Under the <span class="action_menu">Project Actions</span> menu, choose the *Copy media* option.

This will open up the Copy Media panel in the right-hand sidebar.  From the drop-down menu in the Copy Media panel, choose the project from which you wish to copy media.  Once the project is selected in the Copy Media panel, all of the media from that project will be displayed below the drop down box.

Select the media in the Copy Media panel to copy it to the current project.
