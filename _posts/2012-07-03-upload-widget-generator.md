# Upload Widget Generator

\\
Upload widgets are perfect for consumer generated content (ie. your viewers upload content they created directly to a Wistia project).  Using Wistia Upload Widgets creates an "upload button" on a public page you specify.  Upload Widgets are available to enterprise-level plans only.  For more technical information on how Upload Widgets work, read on here: [technical API docs on Upload Widgets]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/upload-widget.html).

To generate an upload widget embed code for a project, follow these steps:

 1.  Login to Wistia and navigate to the project for which you would like to create an upload widget
\\
\\
 1.  From the "Project Actions" menu, select "Get Upload Widget"\\ {{ :get-upload-widget.png?600 |Get Upload Widget}}
\\
\\
 1.  If anonymous uploads are not already enabled for the project, you will be presented with a message explaining the situation and a button to enable anonymous uploads.
\\
\\
{{ :upload-widget-enable-anonymous-uploads.png?600 |Enable Anonymous Uploads}}
\\
\\
 1.  You will be presented with a form where you can copy the embed code for your upload widget after customizing the dimensions and/or button text.  You may need to press the **tab** key on your keyboard to navigate to the next field to see the updates from your changes.
