post_intro: <p>Upload widgets are perfect for consumer generated content (ie. your viewers upload content they created directly to a Wistia project). Using Wistia Upload Widgets creates an "upload button" on a public page you specify. Upload Widgets are available by default to enterprise-level plans only.</p><p>For more technical information on how Upload Widgets work, read on here:<a href="/upload-widget.html"> upload widgets tech specs</a></p>

To generate an upload widget embed code for a project, follow these steps:

Login to Wistia and navigate to the project for which you would like to create an upload widget

From the "Project Actions" menu, select "Get Upload Widget"

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/get-upload-widget.png" alt="get-upload-widget" /></div>

If anonymous uploads are not already enabled for the project, you will be presented with a message explaining the situation and a button to enable anonymous uploads.

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/upload-widget-enable-anonymous-uploads.png" alt="upload-widget-enable-anonymous-uploads" /></div>

You will be presented with a form where you can copy the embed code for your upload widget after customizing the dimensions and/or button text.  You may need to press the **tab** key on your keyboard to navigate to the next field to see the updates from your changes.

<div class="post_image center"><img src="/images/embed-upload-widget.png" alt="embed-upload-widget" /></div>

When you are finished, copy the HTML/JS code into your own page and try it out!
