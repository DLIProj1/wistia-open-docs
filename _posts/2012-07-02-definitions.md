# Wistia Definitions

### Private and Public Projects

`<style float-left s25>`A common question we get here at Wistia HQ is: "if I make my project public, does that mean it can be found in Google searches?" The answer is NO. We respect our client's privacy, and want them to have full control of where/how their customers discover their media. Unless you specifically opt-in for [Wistia Video SEO]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/video-seo.html), your videos are NOT indexed by Google or other search engines.  Our version of "public" simply means it can be accessed through a link and without logging in - but the URL will still be a mystery unless shared directly.

Email `<support@wistia.com>` if you have any concerns over the privacy of your account and/or videos.

### Contact

`<style float-left s25>`A contact is an individual named user that can view and access media within your Wistia account. Contacts can be given permission to download content, upload new videos, or invite other viewers on a project-by-project basis. All contact activity is recorded and viewable within the "User Sessions" portion of Wistia Stats.

### Contact Group

`<style float-left s25>`
A group is a collection of named users.  Contact groups can be invited to projects and given permissions just like an individual contact. Groups are useful for managing complex sharing among large groups of individuals. For example, a group with 200 named users may already be shared on five projects. Adding a new named user to that group, and he/she will automatically have access to all five projects.

### Media

`<style float-left s25>`Within Wistia, media most commonly refers to video, but other file types such as images, documents, and audio files can be uploaded to Wistia and converted to a web-viewable format.

Media are contained in projects and can be embedded on third party websites by adding the Wistia embed code into your HTML (see the Sharing section for more details).

### Managers (a.k.a. Project Admin)

`<style s25>`Managers can:

*  Create and manage projects

*  Create new viewers and manage their permissions

*  Upload video and other media content

*  Invite viewers to privately view video

*  View tracking statistics for private video sharing

*  Publish videos to third party websites (also called "embedding a video")

*  View embedded video statistics

*  Receive email alerts for account activity
`</style>`
Wistia accounts come with 2 managers by default.
\\
### Users (a.k.a. Project Viewers)

`<style s25>`Viewers can:

*  View projects/media 

*  Download media

*  Upload media

*  Share/embed media

*  NOTE: all the above abilities must be activated by the account admin (AKA managers)
`</style>`
Wistia accounts can support an infinite amount of users (theoretically!).
\\
### Project

`<style float-left s25>`A project is a collection of videos or other media files.  Projects can be shared privately by email and serve as an organization for embedded videos. All media (video, audio, images, documents, or other random files) has to be uploaded into a project.  

Projects can be shared privately with named users or via Project Link (see the [Sharing section]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/sharing.html) for more details)

### Video Heatmap

`<style float-left s25>`A video heatmap is a graphical representation of a viewer watching your video.  The video heatmap is shown as a color coded timeline of your video where the colors represent the number of times a viewer has watched a particular part of your video. 

*  White means that portion of the video was not watched

*  green tells you that the viewer watched that part exactly once

*  Yellow, orange, light red, and dark red show you that the viewer watched that part of the video two, three, four, or five times respectively.  
Next to each heatmap is shown the total percentage of the video that viewer watched (parts watched multiple times are only counted once).\\
