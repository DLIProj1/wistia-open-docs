# The Wistia Social Bar

Wistia provides a social button bar for embedded videos.  The buttons on the bar make it easy for your viewers to share your content on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and others.  It also includes a customizable logo area, which can act as a link back to your content for SEO purposes!

Using the Wistia social bar is part of the [embedding process]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/public_sharing.html) for your video. As simple as checking boxes in the [embed builder]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/super_embed_screen#social_sharing.html), you can add additional services to the bar!

## Using the Social Bar for Back Links

Using the social bar logo feature, you can add a back link to your content for SEO purposes.  To do so, first open the embed builder for your video.  Do this by opening the video you'd like to embed, and then selecting "`</>` embed" from under the "Media Actions" drop-down menu.

\\
\\
On the embed builder screen, open the "Social Sharing" section, and check "enabled" to add the social bar to your video embed.  You can add buttons from the list, like Twitter, Tumblr, Stumble Upon, etc.  Below the social sharing list, you will find the "Logo" section.  Enable the logo by checking the box, and then click "change logo".

\\
\\
In the logo configuration window, choose your logo to upload, and also set the URL for where you'd like the link back to point.  Your homepage is probably a good option!
\\
\\
If you make the "embed" social bar option available, your viewers will be able to copy the embed code to put your content on their site, but your logo and link back will still be there!
