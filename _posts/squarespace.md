## How it works

This integration lets you add video to your Squarespace-powered website by just
copying and pasting the URLs of your Wistia videos into the Squarespace interface.

It's almost silly to include step-by-step instructions because this whole process is so simple.
But, what the heck, let's do it!


## 1. Grab your video's URL

{% post_image hashed_id: '69603ded25794005bff860409fb542494c911d96', width: 1035, height: 742 %}

Navigate to a video in your account and copy the URL from your browsers address bar.
I've highlighted the URL in a pink box.


## 2. Add a video block in Squarespace

{% post_image hashed_id: 'cdd78d7532000745430f2968a6fcded98dfc2854', width: 1151, height: 742 %}

Next, go to your Squarespace account and edit a page. Click the "+ Add Block" button on the upper right.
Then in the Add Block dialog, click the Video block.


## 3. Paste in your video URL

{% post_image hashed_id: 'd6656d5570335cc21427c0ac9c1622c768064094', width: 1151, height: 742 %}

Now, just paste in your video's URL that you copied in step 1. When you do this, you should see a message underneath the URL that says "Video Successfully Loaded".

I'd also recommend that you uncheck the "Image Overlay" box. That way if you've customized the starting state of the player, that will be immediately viewable to a visitor.


## 4. Bask in your video embedding glory!

{% post_image hashed_id: 'aacb0ab9c708f79d5dd13b5fe30db32610360a99', width: 1151, height: 742 %}

You're done. That was easy. :)
