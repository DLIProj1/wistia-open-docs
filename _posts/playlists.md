## Playlists and Projects

Wistia playlists are representative of a Project's contents within your Wistia account.

Embedded playlists automatically show the videos contained in the project.  If videos are added to the project, those videos will automatically show up in the playlist.  If the videos are re-ordered in the project, the videos in the playlist will be re-ordered accordingly.  If the titles of the videos in the project are changed....you guessed it, the titles of the videos in the playlist will change as well.

## Creating a Video Playlist

To get started, go into a project in your Wistia account you wish to create a playlist for.  Next, select "Get Playlist" from the Project Actions menu as shown below.

Once you have selected the "Get Playlist" option, you will be taken to a page where you can customize your playlist and get the embed code.  An example of this customization screen can be seen below.

{% post_image hashed_id: '9aee4f07f093a07b72f70e8c2aa8439017043fd2', class: 'center' %}

Choose the **theme** you want to use, the **size** for the embedded playlist, and other customization settings here. These settings will override any customizations you may have applied to the individual videos in your playlist with [Customize]({{ '/customizing-your-video' | post_url }}). 

{{ "There are some functionalities in our app that don't work as fully as we'd like them to with Playlists. If you have questions about any of them, just drop us a line at support@wistia.com." | note }}
