## Operating Systems Supported:

No worries on which operating system your viewers are using - Wistia is friendly with almost every OS on every planet we are aware of, especially:

<div class="clear"></div>

## Browsers Supported:

Wistia will work on any browser that supports Adobe Flash and/or HTML5.  The only requirement for viewing Flash content is Flash Player 7 or greater. To check which version of Flash you are running, please click <html><a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/155/tn_15507.html" target="_new">here</a></html>.  To ensure the best play-back, we typically recommend remaining up to date with your Flash version whenever possible.

For media other than video, No PDF reader is required, as we convert documents to a Flash format as well.  

We also work with all of the major browsers and versions Internet Explorer (6,7,8, and 9), Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, etc.

## Mobile OS Support:

These days, everyone is on mobile devices, and there is consistent strong growth in the mobile video market. At this point, there are basically two main methods to view video on the web: Flash and HTML5. iOS devices, such as iPhones and iPads, support HTML5. Android devices, on the other hand, support mainly Flash video.  Our embed codes are designed to seamlessly flip between HTML5 and Flash, based on the type of device and OS detected.  We have experienced consistent playback on all iOS devices and Android devices running version 2.2 or later.

Blackberry at this point supports neither HTML5 or Flash. As a result, there is not a consistently available way to deliver video via the web to Blackberry devices. For this reason, we are not able to support Blackberry devices for video playback.

Basically, if you can view videos on YouTube or any other major video site, you (and your viewers) should be all set to use Wistia.
