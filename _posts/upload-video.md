All content in Wistia must be uploaded inside a **Project**.
Projects work just like folders on your computer - great for organizing and
managing your stuff.

To create a new Project, select *New Project* under the
<span class="action_menu">Actions</span> menu.

Once you are in your new Project, give it a title by clicking
<span class="edit_tag">&nbsp;</span> next to the title bar
(it's called "Untitled Project" by default).

Now we're ready to upload a video.

Select *Upload Media* under the
<span class="action_menu">Project Actions</span> menu.

From the upload dialogue box, choose the file to upload from your computer.

{{ "To upload multiple media at once, hold down the shift or control buttons while browsing." | note }}

Once a file has been chosen, you will see the progress of the file uploading
as in the image below.

If you are having trouble with uploads completing, please try our
[simple uploader]({{ '/simple-uploader' | post_url }}). Most upload troubles
are caused by Flash plugin issues - the Simple Uploader does not use Flash. One
downside - no progress bar.

For instructions on the best way to encode your video prior to uploading it,
check our [video exporting page]({{ '/export-settings' | post_url }}).
