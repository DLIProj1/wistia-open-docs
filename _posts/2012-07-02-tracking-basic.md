# How to view tracking statistics for my video

There are two main ways to see viewing statistics for your videos.  If you have embedded the video on your website, you will want to see [embedded video statistics]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/tracking-basic#statistics_for_embedded_videos.html).  If you have shared the video privately, you will want to see [statistics for user sessions]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/tracking-basic#statistics_for_user_sessions.html) where people you invited into Wistia viewed your video content.
