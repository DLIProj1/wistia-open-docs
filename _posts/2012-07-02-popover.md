# Adding a Popover Effect to Your Embedded Videos

`<style float-right>`{{:many_popovers.jpeg?300}}`</style>`A video "popover" is indeed a tasty treat - but not of the pastry variety. Instead, it means using a lightbox effect to showcase your video. To viewers, your video seems to jump out of the page after they click a text or image link.\\

Pretty tasty morsel, right? If you are working on a site with scarce real estate, a page that contains a library or long list of videos, or a site with multiple videos that are slowing down load times, a video popover might work well for you.

Enabling video popovers in Wistia is much easier than baking a pastry.
 1.  Email `<support@wistia.com>` and let us know that you would like "oEmbeds" enabled for your account.
 2.  Generate an oEmbed code for the video you'd like to "popover". oEmbed codes can be found on the same screen as regular HTML Embed codes.
 3.  Take the oEmbed code over to our [Video Popover Creator lab]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/http://app.wistia.com/popover.html) and enter the link text that you would like displayed for your video. 
 4.  Grab the newly generated popover code and paste it into your site's HTML

And that's it! Tasty, huh?
