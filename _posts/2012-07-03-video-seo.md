## Getting Set Up

The typical Video SEO workflow is: create the sitemap, add it to the 'root' folder of your website, submit to Google through Webmaster Tools, and check periodically to make sure it is still operating properly.  Each time you add a new video, you'd need to re-create the sitemap and re-submit to Google. *Yuck*.

With Wistia, the work is reduced to what you do best: *create great content*.  Wistia helps you create, host, and submit your video sitemap.

The first thing you need to do is authorize Wistia to host your video sitemap and reference pages on your site. This is done through the robots.txt file on your web server. 
 
## Robots.txt File Setup

<div class="expert_tip">
  <h3><i class='icon-thumbs-up'></i> Robots.txt</h3>
  <img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/661c19b720a884cbafd7b199d63d1d14874cf6e2.png" width="50" />
  <p>When search engines crawl your web content they first look for a file called ‘robots.txt’ in the root of your website. This file tells search engines what to index on your site and also where your video sitemap is located.</p>
  <p>A common SEO problem is blocking search engines from crawling your website with robots.txt, make sure you allow search engines to crawl and find your content.</p>
</div>

A robots.txt file helps search engines know what content they should index. The robots.txt file also has the ability to inform and authorize sitemaps for your website.  To see your robots.txt file, open your browser and head to *yourdomainname*.com/robots.txt (substituting your domain name in).

Updating your robots.txt file is different depending on the CMS or website management system you are using. If you are self-hosting your site, you can edit the robots.txt file in your site's root directory (or create one, if one does not exist). If you are using Wordpress, they have several popular plug-ins for editing your robots.txt file, including [KB-Robots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/kb-robotstxt/) and [PC Robots.txt](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pc-robotstxt/).

{% post_image hashed_id: 'cd5333ac993a15daeab379729834217492736b57', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

You will be adding one line to your robots.txt file that notifies Google your video SEO sitemap is hosted by Wistia. To find the line you'll be adding for your account, open up the Video SEO area of your account, which can be found under the Account menu.

<div class="clear"></div>

{% post_image hashed_id: 'adc7dbb2d06e6ff59a4f99898c852f4785f806ac', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

Once you have added the line to your robots.txt and typed the URL, click the <span class="faux_button">VERIFY YOUR ROBOTS.TXT</span> button.  This will retrieve your specified robots.txt and verify that the information is viewable by Google.

The next step is on Google's end. Google will review the sitemap entries, and check the content they point to (i.e. where you said the video was). It can take up to a week to complete this step.

## Embed Your Videos Using the SEO Embed Type

After your robots.txt file is verified, you will 'unlock' the *SEO* embed code type, which you'll need to use to make sure videos are picked up in search results.

Open the video you'd like to embed, and select *&lt;/&gt; Embed* from the <span class="action_menu">Media Actions</span> menu. For more information on embedding, review the [embedding a video]({{ '/embedding' | post_url }}) guide.

## Making a video sitemap entry

{% post_image hashed_id: 'db21c33ccc521d51de35d2db7804823f1d7a2565', class: 'center' %}

Once you have verified the entry in your robots.txt file, you will be able to add entries to your video sitemap.  Once a video sitemap entry is made, it will be automatically picked up by Google and your content will be indexed according to Google's indexing queue.

The process to make a new video sitemap entry is the fun part of the process!

After you have embedded a video on your website , go to the page in Wistia where you can view the video (e.g. &lt;youraccount&gt;.wistia.com/medias/12345 ).  Hover over the <span class="action_menu">Media Actions</span> menu and select *Add to SEO sitemap*.

{{ "The Video SEO functionality will only work with SEO embeds!" | note }}

In order to have the SEO embed type available for your embeds, you need to have a Video SEO sitemap created and verified.

This will then bring up a dialog box where you can enter the relevant information about your video (like tags, description).

<div class="expert_tip">
  <h3><i class='icon-thumbs-up'></i> Making Sitemap Entries</h3>
  <img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/661c19b720a884cbafd7b199d63d1d14874cf6e2.png" width="50" />
  <p><strong>Title:</strong> I’ve found that having the title of your video match the meta title of your page will help a video snippet appear along with your page in search engine result pages.</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> Be as descriptive as possible but make sure you are not going overboard with keywords you want your video to rank for. Make the description useful for viewers, not for bots.</p>
  <p><strong>Tags:</strong> I’ve found that having 3 to 4 word descriptive tags works best for our videos. Don’t get too wordy with your tags and keep it simple.</p>
</div>

Enter the required information and click <span class="faux_button">Add to video sitemap</span>.  Your sitemap will then be automatically updated and the new changes that should be indexed.

## Managing your video sitemap entries

{% post_image hashed_id: 'cd5333ac993a15daeab379729834217492736b57', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

SEO Sitemap entries can be managed from the video SEO dashboard within your Wistia account.

This will take you to the video SEO dashboard where you can:

*  See all videos currently in your sitemap
*  Edit the sitemap entries by clicking the "Edit" button on any entry
*  Remove any entries that may no longer be valid using the "Remove" button

{% post_image hashed_id: '3f9aac20bc6b0ad0cfc231ef2b29e13b5d0cf932', class: 'center' %}

## Search Results

In the end, the goal is to get your content to rank higher in search engines like Google.  Telling search engines about your content through Wistia's Video SEO feature allows your pages to:

*  Rank higher in basic search results based on the presence and relevance of your video content 
*  When someone clicks on your video in a search engine results page, they will be taken directly to your website
*  Show up as a featured video in search engine results pages
*  Display in video specific search results

  <p>Make sure you have related content on your page so that search engines have context surrounding the video. Once your snippet is shown in search results, you should see a nice increase in click-through-rates!</p>
</div>

## Adding Additional Domains

{% post_image hashed_id: 'ca4b768ca28ebcdb98c56aca16357510954e8cac', width: 320, class: 'float_right' %}

Adding more than one domain to your Video SEO in Wistia is easy to do.  After adding your first domain, a button will appear on the right bar in your Video SEO account section for adding additional domains (see the image at right).  You will be prompted to walk through the same steps as adding your initial domain.

## Video SEO FAQ ##

Video SEO is tough, but valuable. Customers have lots of questions around how to use our Video SEO tool for their business video. We'll attempt to compile them here.

<span class="seo_faq">Do I still need to create an sitemap, or submit something to Google Webmaster Tools?</span>

**Nope!** Wistia tools take care of that process automatically for you. We create a sitemap, add the videos you designate, and submit it through Google Webmaster Tools, all automatically.

<span class="seo_faq">Is hosting my video sitemap with Wistia ok? Will Google accept it?</span>

**Yes.** Google has made cross-submission support via a robots.txt file an accepted and efficient part of the SEO workflow. See [this article from the Google Webmaster Central Blog](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/02/cross-submissions-via-robotstxt-on.html) for more.

<span class="seo_faq">Can I hear Ben talking about SEO?</span>
