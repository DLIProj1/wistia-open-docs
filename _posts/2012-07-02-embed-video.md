When on the page with the video you want to embed, hover your mouse over the "Media Actions" menu and choose "Embed".

This will bring up a dialog which contains the embed code for this video.  Changing either one of the dimensions will cause the other dimension to also be changed, maintaining your video's aspect ratio.  
\\
\\
Once you have the video sized appropriately for your webpage and the appropriate options checked, click in the "Embed Code" box and copy all of the HTML code.  This code can then be pasted directly into the HTML document of the webpage where you wish to embed the video.  

Once you have pasted the embed code into the HTML document and saved it, reload the page in your web browser and the video should then display.  

To view the statistics for your embedded video, select the "Embed tracking" option under the "Stats" tab at the top of any page in your Wistia account.

NOTE: Only managers can embed video and only on projects they control.
